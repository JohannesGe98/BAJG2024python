The lectures may be large, but there is a discussion section each week in which you get personal time with a TA in a group of about twenty students. You can ask any questions that you want at this time, and it's basically a tutoring type of session. I always enjoyed discussion, and office hours are available for both professors and TA's if you ever need more help. Don't believe the idea that you can't get to know a professor; I have been here one quarter, and I already have one professor that knows me by my name. She might even be giving me a research opportunity this following quarter. Therefore, it might be harder than in high school to get to know a professor, but it's definitely not impossible; you simply must just make some extra effort. Also, join many clubs and don't be afraid if you are unsure of a career goal or even your major yet. There's plenty of time to figure it out, and for most science majors, all students take the same general sciences classes their first two years so you can always switch majors later."", 'I truly do think that UC Davis provides an extensive amount of resources that definitely making going to college here worth it. Some of these are the Student Health and Wellness Center (where you can go in to receive free massages), Student Academic Success Center (where there is free tutoring and pre-professional graduate advising), Counseling Center (where you can talk to a counselor for no charge), and the ARC (where all students are able to exercise for free). Besides these, there is the Aggie Job Link and Internship and Career Center that help students find volunteer opportunities, research internships, and jobs in general.', ""Some people consider UC Davis to be a bit dry and dull, but I can now say from personal experience that is definitely not the case. I have gone out every weekend, and there are definitely so many things to do. Sacramento is only twenty minutes away, and I go there frequently. UC Davis downtown is also a quaint environment, and it adds to the college-town atmosphere. The food downtown in absolutely amazing, and they have a diverse number of restaurants. Besides that, UC Davis isn't much of a party scene, but there are definitely a good number of social events happening. I recently joined a coed pre-health fraternity, and I am enjoying every minute of it due to the fact that it provides me both an educational and social outlet. If Greek Life isn't your thing, then have no fear because UC Davis has over 100 different clubs. If you want to join a certain club, I'm sure that they would have it. If they don't have it, you are welcome to start your own club, and they will even provide you a starting budget for it. Overall, what I most enjoy about UC Davis would be how nice the people are. If I were to describe UC Davis in one word, it was be chill. Everyone is relaxed and helpful yet also incredibly gifted and smart. We all help each other to succeed, and that leads to our personal success as well. The positive encouragement from all aspects is truly amazing."", ""I just finished my first quarter at UC Davis, and I will definitely admit that the courses are much more challenging than high school. I always had straight A's in high school, and that is much more difficult here at UC Davis. However, I really am learning a lot and it's an indescribable experience to be challenged in a new manner. UC Davis is one of the top research universities, and it's incredibly inspiring to learn from professors that are discovering new theories and conducting research right in front of your eyes.""]]",University of California-Davis (UC Davis) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Davis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/97914,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,76,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00055-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,897233883,897016572,HORIZONTAL,"07/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 57 out of 59 people found this review useful. 1 of 325 Vianey from rancho cucamonga, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me. Then I visited UC Davis where I saw people running together, sitting together, studying together, talking to one another, playing frisbee and other sports, and in general just enjoying themselves and the company of others...and that's the college experience I knew I wanted. But I can't speak for everyone...some like the rigorous feel of a focused campus. Bang for the buck I believe that the cost of tuition at UC Davis is worth every penny.

But if your like me, and like to go out on the weekends and hangout with friends all the time, then you're in the right place. Being here has allowed me to explore different things that I would've never explored if I didn't have the resources here. Such as being a DJ, through a volunteer program you can become a DJ at KDVS, Davis' own radio station located right on campus! Other opportunities may come up, so always be on the lookout. Am learning a lot If your looking for a great learning experience, there is something important that you have to know, it all depends on YOU. So if you are, the advice I would give you and stuff you've probably already heard is to get to know your professor, research beyond on stuff that you're unfamiliar with. These two suggestions make such a great difference in any school you might choose to go, and here at UC Davis, the professors are amazing.

The main reason I chose Davis over other campuses was because I liked the feel of the community. Not only is it a small town atmosphere, but the people in Davis are very friendly. In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum.

In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me. Then I visited UC Davis where I saw people running together, sitting together, studying together, talking to one another, playing frisbee and other sports, and in general just enjoying themselves and the company of others...and that's the college experience I knew I wanted. But I can't speak for everyone...some like the rigorous feel of a focused campus. Bang for the buck I believe that the cost of tuition at UC Davis is worth every penny.

The degree you earn from UC Davis is a very prestigious achievement and can take you almost anywhere in your future. The school also has a plethora of majors to choose from should you decide to change majors. The campus has its very own internship and career center that is very useful in helping students find local internships, jobs, and research opportunities. The dining commons are definitely worth the money because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re quality smorgasbords, and the food and services are well above average. The new fitness center, the ARC (Activities Recreation Center), is a nicer work out facility than the fitness center IÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked at for three years now, and it comes included with the price of tuition rather than costing 92 dollars per month like my hometown gym. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been very impressed with the overall quality of the professors, the food, the gym, the library, and the services offered by the school, and I would say that itÃ¢Â€Â™s worth all the somewhat expensive cost.

The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me. Then I visited UC Davis where I saw people running together, sitting together, studying together, talking to one another, playing frisbee and other sports, and in general just enjoying themselves and the company of others...and that's the college experience I knew I wanted. But I can't speak for everyone...some like the rigorous feel of a focused campus. Bang for the buck I believe that the cost of tuition at UC Davis is worth every penny. The degree you earn from UC Davis is",True,0,0,"{535489=Never give up! You have the power to do all things through Christ who strengthens you. Philippians 4:13. Everything happens for a reason and never ever lose hope. If there's a will there's a way., 746350=There are over 500 active organizations at UC Davis, so there is already a huge variety of clubs that are based on interests, academics, politics, sexual identity, race, religion, and more. But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more. UC Davis hosts an annual Picnic Day where various organizations provide fun games and offer food for a day full of fun for all ages. The annual Chemistry Magic Show is one that people should not miss!, 615788=UC Davis is a wonderful college located in the heart of Davis, California. It's an excellent school with many opportunities. The ratio of cows to bicycles here seems to be 1:1., 131694=The campus host the Whole Earth Festival, usually in May, where there is live music and cool crafts being sold all week. It is truly a unique UCD experience. Even more popular than that is Picnic Day, the university's open house, with fun things to do in all the departments, a big parade in the morning, and the Band-uh! battling it out at the Arboretum all afternoon against other college bands. It's a town-wide event and always endless amounts of fun., 236860=I will not attend UC Davis until September, but their reputation is phenomenal. I am a pre-vet animal science major, and UC Davis has the best veterinarian program in all of California and most parts of the world. During my visits everyone has been very nice and accommodating, as well as genuinely interested in prospective students., 41713=I was able to get a lot of financial aid, almost a full scholarship for the 2011-2012 year. Especially if your family's income is low-middle class to low, Davis does it's best to keep you from spending $10,000 out of pocket which means no emptying savings or taking private bank loans. They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years. When i was admitted in Fall of 2007, my tuition per quarter was about $2800; now it has skyrocketed to $4600 per quarter., 542848=First make friends with your roommates. Buy a bike with fenders or get fenders for your tires, they come in great use all of Oct. through February. Make the most from eating at the dining commons, it will be only time you won't be thinking what your next meal will be., 321820=Because it's a UC, it's a bit on the pricey side. Out of pocket, I paid about $3500 my freshman year with the help of all the grants I got. The university itself gave me about $1500 last year. I refused to get loans., 424078=picnic day is held in april and is the largest event that every student (or non-student) looks forward to! :), 891985=Get a bike! Don't get 7:30 classes. Go easy the first quarter, 533254=Jeremiah 29:11 For He knows the plans he has for you, to give you a hope & a future., 503477=For the third time, Picnic Day! Also, the football games are fun to attend if you get in the Aggie Pack. The Whole Earth Festival is fun to check out too. Ask around about the Death Star. Did you know there's a pub on campus? Go to the Silo, and right next door is a convenient little pub. At least it was back in 2006.}",,

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

If you are the type of person that likes to party at all times, this isn't the place for you. But if your like me, and like to go out on the weekends and hangout with friends all the time, then you're in the right place. Being here has allowed me to explore different things that I would've never explored if I didn't have the resources here. Such as being a DJ, through a volunteer program you can become a DJ at KDVS, Davis' own radio station located right on campus! Other opportunities may come up, so always be on the lookout. Am learning a lot If your looking for a great learning experience, there is something important that you have to know, it all depends on YOU. So if you are, the advice I would give you and stuff you've probably already heard is to get to know your professor, research beyond on stuff that you're unfamiliar with.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me.

The main reason I chose Davis over other campuses was because I liked the feel of the community. Not only is it a small town atmosphere, but the people in Davis are very friendly. In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery. These restaurants are local to Davis and cheap enough for college students to enjoy.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer.

They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years.

Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out!

Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

The degree you earn from UC Davis is a very prestigious achievement and can take you almost anywhere in your future. The school also has a plethora of majors to choose from should you decide to change majors. The campus has its very own internship and career center that is very useful in helping students find local internships, jobs, and research opportunities. The dining commons are definitely worth the money because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re quality smorgasbords, and the food and services are well above average. The new fitness center, the ARC (Activities Recreation Center), is a nicer work out facility than the fitness center IÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked at for three years now, and it comes included with the price of tuition rather than costing 92 dollars per month like my hometown gym. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been very impressed with the overall quality of the professors, the food, the gym, the library, and the services offered by the school, and I would say that itÃ¢Â€Â™s worth all the somewhat expensive cost.

These two suggestions make such a great difference in any school you might choose to go, and here at UC Davis, the professors are amazing.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis.

With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more. UC Davis hosts an annual Picnic Day where various organizations provide fun games and offer food for a day full of fun for all ages. The annual Chemistry Magic Show is one that people should not miss!, 615788=UC Davis is a wonderful college located in the heart of Davis, California. It's an excellent school with many opportunities. The ratio of cows to bicycles here seems to be 1:1., 131694=The campus host the Whole Earth Festival, usually in May, where there is live music and cool crafts being sold all week. It is truly a unique UCD experience. Even more popular than that is Picnic Day, the university's open house, with fun things to do in all the departments, a big parade in the morning, and the Band-uh! battling it out at the Arboretum all afternoon against other college bands. It's a town-wide event and always endless amounts of fun., 236860=I will not attend UC Davis until September, but their reputation is phenomenal. I am a pre-vet animal science major, and UC Davis has the best veterinarian program in all of California and most parts of the world. During my visits everyone has been very nice and accommodating, as well as genuinely interested in prospective students., 41713=I was able to get a lot of financial aid, almost a full scholarship for the 2011-2012 year. Especially if your family's income is low-middle class to low, Davis does it's best to keep you from spending $10,000 out of pocket which means no emptying savings or taking private bank loans. They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years.

With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation.

There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more.

The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years.

In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it.

In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis.

There are a lot of options and a lot of ethnic, vegan, and vegetarian foods. My boyfriend goes to Berkeley and we both agree Davis food is far better (except their fries). My only problem was that i am EXTREMELY picky and got very tired of the food very fast.

This was great for meeting new people in our area. We had 10 people in our suite and were also best friends with the 8 person suite next door. We all did everything together. This was great for me and the majority of the people in our suites since most of us were the only people in our school to go to Davis.

Of course, it always depends on the teacher. That is why websites like ratemyprofessor can be extremely necessary in college. Science classes are harder, but they mostly take more time since often you have a 3 hours in a week in lecture (like any class) plus 1 hour discussion (also normal) but an additional 3 hours for lab which also has its own set of homework to do outside of class (many people end up taking about 3 hours on the hw a week if you are trying hard to do well). As long as you go to class and can understand your professor, it usually is fine, although still challenging.', ""Study hard and get good SAT scores. Write good essays.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis.

The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer.

There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation.

Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE.

In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more.

The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me. Then I visited UC Davis where I saw people running together, sitting together, studying together, talking to one another, playing frisbee and other sports, and in general just enjoying themselves and the company of others...and that's the college experience I knew I wanted.

People say Segundo is the best place to be at - people are social, the convenience store provides fresh ice cream (Gunthers) and there are lots and lots of snacks compared to the other two convenience stores at Tercero and Cuarto (freshly baked cookies, mochi ice cream, smoothies). Cuarto is the oldest and furthest from campus - but I have friends that live there and their experience was just fine as well. :)"", ""I will say it IS easy to get off track given the fact that Davis is a hard school when it comes to academics, especially if you are a science major. I'm not saying it's impossible, but you definitely need to put in a significant amount of effort and time to succeed! (Counselors recommend 3 hours of study for every hour of lecture. This means reviewing notes right after class, reading the assigned text before lecture, going to class, attending office hours, doing suggested homework problems, etc.)"", ""Bring a bike -- it is the main type of transportation there! Everyone bikes. I would say, don't buy yourself a brand new one, it highly increases the chance of having it being stolen. I feel most people who live off campus ride roadbikes. Maintain a good balance between school and social life! Make sure to study, but also take a break! There are plenty of opportunities out there (i.e. free bowling nights at the MU, picnic day, the Buzz, ARC, intramural sports, etc)."", 'Davis is a very inspiring school to be at.

The degree you earn from UC Davis is a very prestigious achievement and can take you almost anywhere in your future. The school also has a plethora of majors to choose from should you decide to change majors. The campus has its very own internship and career center that is very useful in helping students find local internships, jobs, and research opportunities. The dining commons are definitely worth the money because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re quality smorgasbords, and the food and services are well above average. The new fitness center, the ARC (Activities Recreation Center), is a nicer work out facility than the fitness center IÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked at for three years now, and it comes included with the price of tuition rather than costing 92 dollars per month like my hometown gym. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been very impressed with the overall quality of the professors, the food, the gym, the library, and the services offered by the school, and I would say that itÃ¢Â€Â™s worth all the somewhat expensive cost.

Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me. Then I visited UC Davis where I saw people running together, sitting together, studying together, talking to one another, playing frisbee and other sports, and in general just enjoying themselves and the company of others...and that's the college experience I knew I wanted.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

Still, wandering around campus or Davis alone at night is not very wise. Bad things (muggings, assaults) can happen, but not any more than anywhere else. Most of campus and Downtown is well-lit at night, and police and fire departments are nearby if something ever happens. There are also other services at work for your safety, including the Campus Violence Prevention Program that works to reduce dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault in the campus community. And, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the free Security Escort Service that can drive or walk you to your destination in Davis at night if you donÃƒÂ¢??t feel safe or comfortable moving about at night. There is also an entire department dedicated to UC Davis Safety Services (http://safetyservices.ucdavis.edu/) and you can learn more about how the university works to ensure your safety as a student.', 'I donÃƒÂ¢??t know much about the Greek Life here on campus, but IÃƒÂ¢??m sure it is similar to other Greek Life in other schools. They have charities theyÃƒÂ¢??re involved in and special events. They have various themes and classifications of houses too, including those based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, major, gender, and other identities. For the small percentage of Davis students in fraternities and sororities, the Greek Life is very present on campus.', 'There are over 500 active organizations at UC Davis, so there is already a huge variety of clubs that are based on interests, academics, politics, sexual identity, race, religion, and more. But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis.

With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD.', 'If you donÃƒÂ¢??t mind weather that is somewhat bipolar, then Davis is a great school for you. ItÃƒÂ¢??s excellent for physically active students or those who want to be more active, as the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) on campus was created for students to do just that. Students can improve their physical fitness with a wide range of activities from rock climbing to badminton to receiving personal training to plenty more. UC Davis is also excellent for those who have academics high on their priority list. The college itself puts great emphasis on academic excellence, and there are too many school-related resources to count that can help you out. For instance, the Student Academic Success Center offers assistance and tutoring to help students improve their skills in various subjects such as chemistry, physics, math, and writing. If youÃƒÂ¢??re outdoorsy or just love nature, than UCD is also great for you. Everywhere you look on campus, youÃƒÂ¢??ll find different, beautiful species of plants. And, the Arboretum offers 100 acres of gorgeous gardens right on campus which is excellent for walking, running, picnicking, studying, or just hanging out and enjoying the natural splendor. All in all, UC Davis is great for a variety of students, and youÃƒÂ¢??ll probably find your own niche that truly suits you at this school. You donÃƒÂ¢??t really have to be any of the things I just mentioned; Davis is also about finding yourself, being who you are or want to be, and choosing your own path in life.', 'One quirky tradition that I know of is the Bossy Cow Cow chant. The Cal Aggie Marching Band-uh! uses this odd cheer before football games and this funny, farm-themed chant has a little dance that accompanies it. Otherwise, UC Davis is stereotypically known for being a highly agricultural setting. That is, many students take tractor driving, we have an entire college for Agricultural (and Environmental) Studies, and the university was originally a farm owned by the College of Agriculture at UC Berkeley. But, UCD is not all about farming and agriculture, though this is one of the best places to learn about it and personally I think itÃƒÂ¢??s a neat quirk about Davis. The Cal Aggie Band-uh! is steeped in tradition (unusual and otherwise). It is a crazily awesome, student-run organization that performs at many university sporting events and for the local community. It is filled with Aggie pride and is a part of UC Davis history. A near rite of passage at UCD is taking Intro to Winemaking or Intro to Beer and Brewing. It is rare to attend a school that offers classes on the science behind wine and beer, and that is partly why so many students take classes like these. YouÃƒÂ¢??ll also find odd and interesting forms of art around campus. For instance, you have the Eggheads, seven intriguing ceramic sculptures of white, bald heads doing odd things around campus, which former UC Davis professor Robert Arneson created himself. The outdoor public art collection at Davis is fascinating, beautiful and it brings a more unusual life to the locations where one finds the pieces of this art collection.', 'Of all seven of the colleges that accepted me, not counting the community college, Davis was one of the most affordable for my freshman year. Of course, scholarships helped a bunch. But, the financial aid is pretty great (though it can vary, IÃƒÂ¢??m sure), especially if you qualify for the Blue and Gold Opportunity Program. For sophomore year, my financial aid seems less substantial. I donÃƒÂ¢??t have the scholarships that I did before and the school is expecting me to get a job, which is understandable, so my family and I are expected to pay more. But, itÃƒÂ¢??s still really worth it to attend UC Davis. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a great school and the general atmosphere and feeling in Davis is excellent. The professors, the opportunities for undergraduate research, the resources available to help students, and most everything else at Davis is just splendid and definitely a good bang for the buck in my experience.', 'IÃƒÂ¢??m just going to get this out there and be honest with something that I didnÃƒÂ¢??t know during my college search. I hope this helps you: there arenÃƒÂ¢??t party schools and non-party schools. Every school is a party school. That is, there is partying in the student body of every college in America. True, some students party more than others, so if youÃƒÂ¢??re into that, than you can certainly find that at UC Davis. But, there are certainly alternatives. First of all, you can join clubs and organizations at Davis. You can tie yourself directly into your interests or hobbies, considering there are over 500 clubs and organizations at Davis. You can also establish your own club if you donÃƒÂ¢??t find one that suits you. And then, there is downtown Davis, which has three movie theatres, an awesome central park, dozens of diverse places to grab a bite to eat, and much more. And, itÃƒÂ¢??s right next to campus. You can also take fun classes at Davis, such as Tractor Driving, Intro to Winemaking, Archery, Human Sexuality, and Freshman Seminars. You can go for a walk in the beautiful, luscious Arboretum. You can join the hoopla and cheer on our Aggies at any sporting event with the Aggie Pack. You can partake in the excitement of Picnic Day, an enormous annual showcase of UC Davis and the surrounding community that includes over 200 events such as the Battle of the Marching Bands, Chemistry Magic Show, Doxie Derby Race, Picnic Day Parade, and much more.', 'Like I said, the dining commons food in Cuarto is often far better than that of Tercero or Segundo, though many students disagree. Cuarto tends to have more vegetarian and vegan options, though all three DCÃƒÂ¢??s have those alternatives. It also has a salad bar with more variety and fewer people to serve so it is often less crowded. But on the whole, as far as collegiate dining goes, UC Davis has some of the best DC food out there. The atmospheres of the facilities themselves are excellent and varied from DC to DC, which is nice to have. There are other places on campus to grab food, such as the Coffee House, the Silo Union, Biobrew, Scrubs, two Starbucks, and three convenience stores that correspond with the three DCÃƒÂ¢??s. ThereÃƒÂ¢??s even a pub on campus (though the under 21 rule still applies). These places are often very convenient, well-priced, delicious, and/or have a diverse selection.', ""You have quite a few options of on campus housing for your first year and beyond. If you want a stronger social sphere and the easy closeness to many of your classes on campus, then the Segundo and Tercero residential areas are best. But, they can also be somewhat more crowded, for instance, since in Tercero you often live in a triple dorm. You may also live in the Cuarto area, which is smaller, somewhat quieter, more remote (it's an extra five minute bike ride to anywhere on campus), and technically off campus. But, thereÃƒÂ¢??s a park nearby, the Dining Commons and all the residential resources for Cuarto are much closer, and the Cuarto DC food is superior (at least in many peopleÃƒÂ¢??s opinions). Unlike in Tercero and Segundo, it can be harder to make friends nearby. In all the residential areas IÃƒÂ¢??ve just mentioned there are great opportunities for Residence Hall leadership, intermural sports leagues, and dorm socials, as well. Lately, some freshmen have been placed in Primero Grove, a community of on campus apartments, which IÃƒÂ¢??m sure must also be excellent, though IÃƒÂ¢??m not very familiar with them. If IÃƒÂ¢??m not mistaken, this yearÃƒÂ¢??s set of incoming freshmen are guaranteed housing for two years, and although living in the dorms is quite nice and convenient, it is somewhat expensive."", 'You will hardly find a class at UC Davis that is truly a cake walk. You will definitely work for all your units and your education as a whole. But, you will also learn a ton of information in classes, and you will gain skills in applying the knowledge you absorb. The professors and grad student assistants are approachable, knowledgeable, and effective in their instruction. You can explore and discover what interests you with an Undeclared major and with the great variety of classes at Davis. Maybe UCD does not have the fame of Ivy League schools, but it is still very excellent and respectable in its academics and you still leave with an outstanding education.', 'You should definitely take AP classes and try to do well on AP tests! They give you a better feel of what college courses are like, and if you do well enough your scores can substitute certain courses so you donÃƒÂ¢??t have to take those classes in college. Enough AP credit can save you tuition costs at Davis or elsewhere if you are able to finish in less than four years with your surplus of units. And, it looks great on a college application. Also, YOU NEED TO FILE FOR THE FAFSA!!! Even if you donÃƒÂ¢??t think you will qualify for anything much, itÃƒÂ¢??s still worthwhile. Be connected with your schoolÃƒÂ¢??s Career Counselor or other staff member who works to help you with college, scholarships, and jobs since those people are great to have for almost any college-related matter. It is definitely a good idea to have a bike before arriving at Davis. You need to be a basically competent rider, and you should get a GOOD bike lock. And, donÃƒÂ¢??t be intimidated by bike circles: yield to people already in the circle, stay alert, and you should be fine! Like other reviewers will say, take a tour of the college! The campus is beautiful. I would recommend doing Decision Day for Davis since you can take a tour and get a more extensive knowledge and feel for Davis than with just a campus tour. As far as I know freshmen arenÃƒÂ¢??t allowed to park their cars on campus, so know that you probably wonÃƒÂ¢??t be bringing a car your first year.', 'UC Davis is an excellent school that seems highly overlooked in many college searches considering the excellent academics, research and volunteering opportunities, extracurricular activities, and Aggie pride. Students are genuinely happy to be at UC Davis. The university really wants students to learn and succeed here, so there are countless programs, services, and resources that are made available to students to answer the questions they have and give them the help they seek.']]",University of California-Davis (UC Davis) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Davis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/97914,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,162,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00055-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,897233883,897016572,HORIZONTAL,"07/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 57 out of 59 people found this review useful. 1 of 325 Vianey from rancho cucamonga, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

Tips for prospective students I would recommend visiting any college that you are considering and base your decision on the feel of the community (big city or small town, warm or cold weather, relaxed or competitive, etc.) as well as whether or not they have your major. If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me.

The degree you earn from UC Davis is a very prestigious achievement and can take you almost anywhere in your future. The school also has a plethora of majors to choose from should you decide to change majors. The campus has its very own internship and career center that is very useful in helping students find local internships, jobs, and research opportunities. The dining commons are definitely worth the money because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re quality smorgasbords, and the food and services are well above average. The new fitness center, the ARC (Activities Recreation Center), is a nicer work out facility than the fitness center IÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked at for three years now, and it comes included with the price of tuition rather than costing 92 dollars per month like my hometown gym. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been very impressed with the overall quality of the professors, the food, the gym, the library, and the services offered by the school, and I would say that itÃ¢Â€Â™s worth all the somewhat expensive cost.

There are parties and friendly people about. The Arboretum is a beautiful place to walk or bike around. It's a nice place to study or bring a picnic. There are some thrift stores, consignment stores, Forever 21 type stores, and expensive-looking little clothing stores to shop at, not to mention the compulsory book stores, record stores, and froyo places. Additionally, it's a big college with a lot of active people. There's always an event going on somewhere."", ""Of the three dining commons, the Cuarto DC is easily the best. However, all of them offer tasty options. Those who are vegetarian or vegan will have plenty of options. Those less interested in veggies will be surprised at what they find themselves enjoying by the end of the year. As for other food in the area, good crepes can be had at the Silo. The farmers' market has a delightful array of fresh fruits, veggies, and other foods. Several delightful restaurants in the area also make it easy to find a tasty bite to eat."", 'I strongly recommend that a first year at UC Davis stay in the dorms. My entire floor became friends. Others met people from other buildings or floors, but with friendly people everywhere, and in such close proximity, it is easy to find someone to hang out with. The shy will surprise themselves with how quickly they form alliances.', 'Davis is an excellent school. You will get a good education here. The sciences are particularly strong, of course. Davis is an agricultural school after all. Biology, ecology, food science, and science and society are all exciting, but the humanities department is not lacking either. You will be challenged, and employers will look with approval on your degree.', 'Visit Davis. Take the advice you have no doubt already heard about visiting places: talk to people. We are happy to speak to you. Visit downtown, because it is adorable and pleasant, both busy and relaxing.', 'If UCs corresponded to Hogwarts houses, Davis would be Hufflepuff, and this more of a compliment than you realize. The students are hardworking and dedicated, but the real charm is how friendly it is. I have never heard of a student unhappy to be there, and even those who chose other schools have words of ready praise for its academic excellence and pleasant atmosphere.']]",University of California-Davis (UC Davis) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-California-Davis/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/97914,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,170,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00055-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,897233883,897016572,HORIZONTAL,"07/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 57 out of 59 people found this review useful. 1 of 325 Vianey from rancho cucamonga, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The degree you earn from UC Davis is a very prestigious achievement and can take you almost anywhere in your future. The school also has a plethora of majors to choose from should you decide to change majors. The campus has its very own internship and career center that is very useful in helping students find local internships, jobs, and research opportunities. The dining commons are definitely worth the money because theyÃ¢Â€Â™re quality smorgasbords, and the food and services are well above average. The new fitness center, the ARC (Activities Recreation Center), is a nicer work out facility than the fitness center IÃ¢Â€Â™ve worked at for three years now, and it comes included with the price of tuition rather than costing 92 dollars per month like my hometown gym. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve been very impressed with the overall quality of the professors, the food, the gym, the library, and the services offered by the school, and I would say that itÃ¢Â€Â™s worth all the somewhat expensive cost.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

Also, each display card is color coated, the color indicating whether it is vegan, vegetarian, spicy, a favorite, etc. Also, for picky eaters who do not want to try the Mongolian BBQ, falafels, or other exotic foods can always chose to eat burgers, pizza, sandwiches, and salad.

Instead, we filled out three room preferences, each with criteria including which dorm we wanted to live in, room occupancy, single sex or co-ed floor, program or non-program, and room style (suite, standard, etc.). Due to an abundance of housing applicants, I now live in a triple in the Segundo housing area (which was in my opinion the best out of all the choices). Online, my room is listed as a double because that was what it was originally intended for; however, this room would be a huge double because even with three people and all our stuff, we still have a lot of room space (I live in a corner room, so that might be why).

Floor activities put on by the resident advisors and intramural sports are also a great way to meet people.', ""I never was one to look at ranking systems before choosing which colleges I would go to because I never quite understood how ranking could be such a big deciding factor for others. I mean, shouldn't the person who goes there rank it for themselves on their own scale? Anyway, regardless of how UC Davis is portrayed ranking-wise, I am learning so much here after only about a month and though the calculus, chemistry, and sociology classes I am taking are rigorous, I am receiving all the help I could possibly need by going to drop-in tutoring, office hours, academic advising, and so on."", 'As most people know, Davis is known for being a bike-friendly campus. I would advise any prospective students to take into account how they are going to travel around campus or downtown at whatever college they choose, because all things worth going to, in Davis at least, are easily accessible by bike, car, bus, or even on foot.

Tips for prospective students I would recommend visiting any college that you are considering and base your decision on the feel of the community (big city or small town, warm or cold weather, relaxed or competitive, etc.) as well as whether or not they have your major. If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis.

They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE.

In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

The main reason I chose Davis over other campuses was because I liked the feel of the community. Not only is it a small town atmosphere, but the people in Davis are very friendly. In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis.

They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE.

I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying.

The main reason I chose Davis over other campuses was because I liked the feel of the community. Not only is it a small town atmosphere, but the people in Davis are very friendly. In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery. These restaurants are local to Davis and cheap enough for college students to enjoy. But as if thatÃ¢Â€Â™s not enough to satisfy oneÃ¢Â€Â™s appetite, the campus has an amazing buffet-style dining commons that serves meals for all types of eaters",True,0,0,"{535489=Never give up! You have the power to do all things through Christ who strengthens you. Philippians 4:13. Everything happens for a reason and never ever lose hope. If there's a will there's a way., 746350=There are over 500 active organizations at UC Davis, so there is already a huge variety of clubs that are based on interests, academics, politics, sexual identity, race, religion, and more. But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more. UC Davis hosts an annual Picnic Day where various organizations provide fun games and offer food for a day full of fun for all ages. The annual Chemistry Magic Show is one that people should not miss!, 615788=UC Davis is a wonderful college located in the heart of Davis, California.

It is truly a unique UCD experience. Even more popular than that is Picnic Day, the university's open house, with fun things to do in all the departments, a big parade in the morning, and the Band-uh! battling it out at the Arboretum all afternoon against other college bands. It's a town-wide event and always endless amounts of fun., 236860=I will not attend UC Davis until September, but their reputation is phenomenal.

They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years.

I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

Tips for prospective students I would recommend visiting any college that you are considering and base your decision on the feel of the community (big city or small town, warm or cold weather, relaxed or competitive, etc.) as well as whether or not they have your major. If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it. Some campuses are very focused on academics; others are more relaxed and social. I visited campuses where everyone I saw was isolated and either listening to mp3 players, reading books, or just walking or sitting alone. I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me. Then I visited UC Davis where I saw people running together, sitting together, studying together, talking to one another, playing frisbee and other sports, and in general just enjoying themselves and the company of others...and that's the",True,0,0,"{535489=Never give up!

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care.

Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer. With all that variety, you can be sure to find clubs and activities that you want to experience or become involved with at UCD., 43033=I live in Tercero Wall Hall which is right next to a farm of very handsome cows. There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation. It's difficult sitting that long but for a school to do something like that and to give you so many resources in case you're ever in trouble, it shows that they REALLY REALLY care. Last but not least, BEST GYM EVERRRR and its free!!, 866686=UC Davis is best known for its Picnic Day celebration, so for any prospective students trying to get a feel for the town and campus's environment, I suggest you check that day out! It's held in April on the Arboratem, which is basically the prettiest place you'll ever see. Also, the campus gets all four seasons (which is a huge plus for me, having grown up in So-Cal)., 69398=The college town of Davis has places where students can go for fun. There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more. UC Davis hosts an annual Picnic Day where various organizations provide fun games and offer food for a day full of fun for all ages. The annual Chemistry Magic Show is one that people should not miss!, 615788=UC Davis is a wonderful college located in the heart of Davis, California. It's an excellent school with many opportunities. The ratio of cows to bicycles here seems to be 1:1., 131694=The campus host the Whole Earth Festival, usually in May, where there is live music and cool crafts being sold all week. It is truly a unique UCD experience. Even more popular than that is Picnic Day, the university's open house, with fun things to do in all the departments, a big parade in the morning, and the Band-uh! battling it out at the Arboretum all afternoon against other college bands. It's a town-wide event and always endless amounts of fun., 236860=I will not attend UC Davis until September, but their reputation is phenomenal. I am a pre-vet animal science major, and UC Davis has the best veterinarian program in all of California and most parts of the world. During my visits everyone has been very nice and accommodating, as well as genuinely interested in prospective students., 41713=I was able to get a lot of financial aid, almost a full scholarship for the 2011-2012 year. Especially if your family's income is low-middle class to low, Davis does it's best to keep you from spending $10,000 out of pocket which means no emptying savings or taking private bank loans. They have the Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan which provided me with and extra $5,000. Look it up. It's amazing. The other private school I wanted to attend asked me to take $10,000 out of various federal loans and and an additional $25,000. Davis offers the same great opportunities plus some since it's bigger at a cheaper school. I definitely feel grateful I had the option of picking this one instead. The financial package is slightly overestimated so if you have all your aid completely covered, usually at the end there's still $2000-5000 left for spending on sweatshirts, athletics, summer courses, etc. Usually students will save this up to pay back their loans or they'll live extravagantly and spend it all throughout the year., 453558=picnic day every year in april, which is an event that involves the whole town with many activities and a parade, as well as other things. there is a pub on campus which is interesting, but pricey. there is also a club established on campus whose sole purpose is to climb every building on campus., 394511=As we all know, UC system has been going through tuition hikes throughout the past 3 years. When i was admitted in Fall of 2007, my tuition per quarter was about $2800; now it has skyrocketed to $4600 per quarter., 542848=First make friends with your roommates. Buy a bike with fenders or get fenders for your tires, they come in great use all of Oct. through February. Make the most from eating at the dining commons, it will be only time you won't be thinking what your next meal will be., 321820=Because it's a UC, it's a bit on the pricey side. Out of pocket, I paid about $3500 my freshman year with the help of all the grants I got. The university itself gave me about $1500 last year. I refused to get loans., 424078=picnic day is held in april and is the largest event that every student (or non-student) looks forward to! :), 891985=Get a bike! Don't get 7:30 classes. Go easy the first quarter, 533254=Jeremiah 29:11 For He knows the plans he has for you, to give you a hope & a future., 503477=For the third time, Picnic Day! Also, the football games are fun to attend if you get in the Aggie Pack. The Whole Earth Festival is fun to check out too. Ask around about the Death Star. Did you know there's a pub on campus? Go to the Silo, and right next door is a convenient little pub. At least it was back in 2006.}",,

In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis.

There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons. On top of the great healthy food in the DC, there is also a farmer's market twice a week. There aren't many fast food places close by except for Carl's Jr. but there are tons of small business restaurants. THEY TAKE CARE OF YOU HERE. There's a tipsy taxi and and an escort service (I know, it's a bad name) to walk you if you're scared of going home alone in the dark. They spend 6 hrs taking about safety and sexual harassment and health during freshman orientation.

There are local movie theaters in Downtown Davis--all within walking or biking distance. There are many local boutiques and major fashion chains like Forever 21 for shoppers. There is an arcade at the center of UC Davis's campus for students and the public to bowl, dance, and play pool. UC Davis also hosts various concerts at affordable prices. In early 2012, Drake visited the campus and performed. Past performers include K$sha, Snoop Dogg, and much more.

Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

Tips for prospective students I would recommend visiting any college that you are considering and base your decision on the feel of the community (big city or small town, warm or cold weather, relaxed or competitive, etc.) as well as whether or not they have your major. If you're not sure what major you want, it would be wise to pick a college that has lots of majors to choose from. Probably the most important factor in your college-selection process should be based on the feel of the campus when you visit it.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

I didn't see anyone talking to anyone else or socializing at all, and that just wasn't for me.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

There are 9 new buildings this fall (2011) and they're still constructing new ones opening in the next year or two. These residence halls are fantastic. They come more furnished than other schools AND my favorite part, the three person rooms are overly roomy! They are also about $2000 less a year than a typical 2 person room which means $2000 extra to save. Davis is known for their Dining Commons.

In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery.

I learned a lot in my classes, but it wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t what I would call easy. I always did well in high school, but at UC Davis thereÃ¢Â€Â™s a much more noticeable connection between hard work and success. In high school, you can just know the material, hardly study, and still get good grades. This is not the case at UC Davis. To earn good grades, you must put in lots and lots of time studying effectively. I, personally, treat my scholastic career like a fulltime job by spending 40 or more hours per week studying. There is no question that you will learn a lot at UC Davis, but how well you do in your classes is totally dependent upon how hard you study.

The main reason I chose Davis over other campuses was because I liked the feel of the community. Not only is it a small town atmosphere, but the people in Davis are very friendly. In fact, theyÃ¢Â€Â™re beyond friendly; itÃ¢Â€Â™s not uncommon for people to go out of their way to help you, and itÃ¢Â€Â™s very comforting to be in such welcoming surroundings. There is an endless list of other sensational attributes that Davis has to offer, such as the bowling alley and arcade located in the very center of campus, the always entertaining Division 1 athletics program, the largest annual student-run event in the nation (Picnic Day), a very new and cutting edge work out facility, semiweekly farmerÃ¢Â€Â™s markets, a very proactive Greek community, and running/bike paths encircling a large pond and arboretum. Davis also has great one-of-a-kind restaurants such as the Hotdogger (a hole-in-the-wall hot dog vendor), Burgers and Brew (a local burger joint that is open until 3 A.M. every single night), and the delicious Yoloberry frozen yogurt eatery. These restaurants are local to Davis and cheap enough for college students to enjoy.

But, you can also start your own club. You could participate in community service, which is facilitated through the Internship and Career Center and student organizations at Davis. If you come to Davis, your residence hall will put on socials, like the residence hall winter formal (Dormal), and the Dining Commons will put on special events as well. And then, thereÃƒÂ¢??s the glorious madness of Picnic Day every April (see my ÃƒÂ¢??What to do for funÃƒÂ¢??). The annual Activities Fair in the fall showcases over 180 clubs for students to learn a great deal more about all the organizations and activities at this college. ItÃƒÂ¢??s fairly easy to get involved with clubs and activities on campus, since you can hardly throw a rock without hitting a flyer, banner, booth, sign, or another student who could inform you about one of myriad student activities and organizations that UC Davis, if not the city of Davis itself, has to offer.

Perhaps the major one is BemÃ¢Â€Â™s reliance on low p-value to show that ESP exists. In the Bayesian world, unlike the frequentist one, p-value is viewed as a flawed metric for testing hypotheses. The following is a hypothetical example from Freeman: Bayesians and Bem's ESP paper Submitted by Bill Peterson, based on a suggestion from Priscilla Bremser To be continued...

What sort of data, other than loan default rates could be collected to measure how effective colleges are. 1. Should loan default rates be adjusted for the demographics of the student population? Questions The commercial colleges say the rule, as proposed, would cut off education opportunities for low-income and minority students with too few educational options. But consumer advocacy groups say that it would eliminate only the programs whose students have the highest loan-default rates, and, in the process, help protect both students and taxpayers from programs that take in millions of dollars of federal aid but leave students mired in debt. There are differing opinions on whether this is a good thing. Starting next year, colleges that have default rates greater than 30 percent for three consecutive years","The p-value is numerically the same regardless of sample size; in particular, the last row is evidence that treatment A and B are equivalent despite the continuing low p-value. To bring things back to BemÃ¢Â€Â™s paper, assume that treatment A has ESP and B does not. Here is another example known as LindleyÃ¢Â€Â™s paradox which demonstrates that p-value is a flawed metric; such analysis was first published about 80 years ago. Although this example involves 98,451 births of boys and girls, it could just as well deal with ESP successes and failures. Let's imagine a certain town where 49,581 boys and 48,870 girls have been born over a certain time period. The observed proportion (x) of male births is thus 49,581/98,451 = 0.5036. We are interested in testing whether the true proportion (ÃŽÂ¸) is 0.5. That is, our null hypothesis is Ã‚Â H0: ÃŽÂ¸ = 0.5Ã‚Â  and the alternative is Ã‚Â H1: ÃŽÂ¸ Ã¢Â‰Â  0.5. Because the sample size is very large, the normal approximation to the binomial holds; the mean proportion under the null is .5 and the variance is Ã‚Â ÃÂƒ2 Ã¢Â‰Âˆ x(1Ã¢ÂˆÂ’x)/n, or (.5036)(.4964)/98,451. Using the normal approximation above, the upper tail probability is the one-sided p-value http://community.middlebury.edu/~wpeterso/Chance_News/images/CN71_Bem1.png By symmetry, the two-sided p-value is double that, .0234 which indicates statistical significance.

But it would be great if I can mix the 2 lists and decide the global order of my page elements (i.e. image1, video1, image2, image3, video 2... ) ecc.

I would love to have the possibility to mix different CCK fields in the same list with draggable items. hi, February 24, 2010 at 8:34am aneuryzma on Posted by Dec 17, 2012 at 6:41am Last updated on register to","Log in or register to post comments Comment #2 aminalid CreditAttribution: aminalid commented July 20, 2011 at 5:34pm Would like to have this functionality too.

The valid values for input_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹, along with the valid OpenGL primitive types, are: layout(input_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹) in; Each geometry shader is designed to accept a specific Primitive type as input and to output a specific primitive type. The accepted input primitive type is defined in the shader:  Primitive in/out specification The other feature was GS instancing, which allows multiple invocations to operate over the same input primitive. This makes layered rendering easier to implement and possibly faster performing, as each layer's primitive(s) can be computed by a separate GS instance.  In OpenGL 4.0, GS's gained two new features: the ability to write to multiple output streams. This is used exclusively with transform feedback, such that different feedback buffer sets can get different transform feedback data.    Transform Feedback: This is often employed for doing computational tasks on the GPU (obviously pre-Compute Shader).  Layered rendering: taking one primitive and rendering it to multiple images without having to change bound rendertargets and so forth.  While the GS can be used to amplify geometry, implementing a form of tessellation, this is not the primary use for the feature. The general uses for GS's are:  Geometry shader invocations take a single Primitive as input and may output zero or more primitives.","The vertex count is the number of vertices that the GS receives per-input primitive. The output primitive type is defined as follows: layout(output_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹, max_vertices = vert_countÃ¢Â€Â‹) out; The output_primitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹ may be one of the following: pointsÃ¢Â€Â‹ line_stripÃ¢Â€Â‹ triangle_stripÃ¢Â€Â‹ These work exactly the same way their counterpart OpenGL rendering modes do. To output individual triangles or lines, simply use EndPrimitiveÃ¢Â€Â‹ (see below) after emitting each set of 3 or 2 vertices. There must be a max_verticesÃ¢Â€Â‹ declaration for the output. The number must be a compile-time constant, and it defines the maximum number of vertices that will be written by a single invocation of the GS. It may be no larger than the implementation-defined limit of MAX_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_VERTICES. The minimum value for this limit is 256. See the limitations below.

Vertex shaders have a 1:1 ratio of vertices input to vertices output. Each vertex shader invocation gets one vertex in and writes one vertex out., 84106=A Geometry Shader (GS) is a Shader program written in GLSL that governs the processing of primitives. It happens after primitive assembly, as an additional optional step in that part of the pipeline. A GS can create new primitives, unlike vertex shaders, which are limited to a 1:1 input to output ratio. A GS can also do layered rendering; this means that the GS can specifically say that a primitive is to be rendered to a particular layer of the framebuffer., 110187=For example, if the total output component count is 1024 (the smallest maximum value from GL 4.3), and the output stream writes to 12 components, the total number of vertices that can be written is 1024/12 = 85. This is the absolute hard limit to the number of vertices that can be written; even if GL_MAX_GEOMETRY_OUTPUT_VERTICES is larger than 85, because each vertex takes up 12 components, the true maximum that this particular geometry shader can write is 85 vertices.}",,
