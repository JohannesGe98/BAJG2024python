The monthly cost ended up at around $1300 per month, which could theoretically pay for a luxury apartment or even a mortgage on a house. The school does offer scholarships to everyone who qualifies for and attends the Honors program so that helps. You can sign up for a payment plan if you can't pay a lump sum for tuition and fees., 20644=FAU itself is very reasonable. If you live off campus (which I recommend after freshmore year), do so. FAU does not charge a million different fees. The parking permits are free, but don't dare park illegally. They're too quick. Boca Raton is an expensive city - gas is expensive here (comparably), clothes and jewelry and all of that glitz is expensive. The best bang for the buck are these hole in the wall food places that immigrants own - they're the best. I don't know anyone that goes to a chain restaurant. There's a local sushi place that gets FLOODED with FAU students on Friday and Saturday nights. Car insurance is cheap in this city for some reason. Rent is a little ridiculous. I come from tampa, and I could get a beautiful remodeled apartment for $750. $750 in Boca Raton is the hood. I mean not a nice area at all. Your average 1 bedroom in a nice area can run from $850 to over $1000. Get a roommate., 1082145=A myriad of food choices (including starbucks and einstein bagels!) on campus but make sure you eat at a decent hour. If you have night classes (from 4:30 and on) the food stores will be closed. If they do close, there's a lot to eat within a 1-2 mile radius including, but not limited to, jamba juice, moe's, cheesecake factory, and another starbucks!, 338030=There has never been a time where I feel unsafe on campus, even when I am walking across campus at 11:30 PM after work. For those who do not want to walk because they feel unsafe, we have NightOwls, a free golfcart service that runs all over campus on weeknights until 11:30 PM. There are also the yellow poles placed everywhere on campus that have emergency buttons that contact the police. They will send a unit out to your exact location., 746914=The campus is extremely safe, we have a police station both on campus, and literally across the street. There are lights, and emergency phones peppered throughout the campus to prevent and reassure people who may be going that extra mile with the class going past 9:00, or coming back from the library, gym, etc. The students are incredibly considerate of one another's belongings and I can personally say I have never witnessed a theft, despite dropping my wallet on the ground, leaving my car unlocked, leaving my room unlocked and all the risky behaviours advised against., 970974=Good dorms. They just built new dorms opening in fall 2013, 281595=i find the classes i am taking and have taken at fau to be challenging, depending on the subject of course. i am presently taking a spanish intermediate class and i have been learning quite a bit about latin american countries as well as very useful grammar., 1015412=If you are planning to apply or attend FAU, I suggest that you prepare ahead of time and don't miss any deadlines! For example there are scholarships that the school offers. The award of some of these scholarships is determined at the time your application is review. However, there are other scholarships that the school offers that you must apply for individually. Most of the deadlines for these scholarships is in the beginning of January , therefore apply early! In addition make sure you make yourself familiar with people and numbers that are the most helpful to you. For example, freshman advisers and financial aid office employees are the most important to familiarize yourself with. It will come in handy., 445538=I am here on scholarship, and there are still many facilities at the college that I do not use. If you do explore and take part in what the college has to offer, you may find it a good bang for your buck. Tuition goes up a lot every semester, and the addition of the new stadium for our loosing football team does not make it any better, let alone all these funding cuts of 2012. Classes are being taken off and availability is less. Teachers in certain programs are being let go, and only the difficult(personality, not by material) ones seem to be left. I think there should be improvement in the library... it looks old. There are many places to study, one must simply find there nook which they deem comfortable., 6974=FAU is the perfect mix of learning and fun. We all have to be responsible for getting ourselves to class and absorb and retain the days lessons. When the classes are done, however, the fun begins. Dorm life is awesome and there√¢¬Ä¬ôs plenty to do around here. The students are friendly and fun-loving. We all take care of each other and are a close-knit community. The professors seem to enjoy their work and are very helpful. The gym is free and open until late so even those of us who work can get our workouts in. The cafeteria services are great; the food is fresh and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs open until about 10:30 pm for dinner, which means we can still get real food instead of cold, pre-packaged sandwiches or snacks from our dorms. We have our own little town on campus with many conveniences--yes, even a fast-food court for those who miss being back home. When we went to get out, though, the big city is just a street light away with hordes of activities and amenities, including some of the most beautiful beaches., 938140=Plenty of scholarships, they gave me 1000 dollars for summer classes just because I answered some questions early. Not too expensive, and good quality., 1014528=At FAU, first time students are required to attend an orientation session that covers the length of two days. All sessions are require you to sleep overnight at the institution, except for the Early Owls orientation. When I went, we slept in Heritage Park Towers it is nice and quaint although it does not have an open common area like Indian River Towers and the new Parliament Hall opening up in Fall 2013. I myself will be staying in HPT (acronym that you will hear very often) and I find it to be reasonable for my needs.

For example there are scholarships that the school offers. The award of some of these scholarships is determined at the time your application is review. However, there are other scholarships that the school offers that you must apply for individually. Most of the deadlines for these scholarships is in the beginning of January , therefore apply early! In addition make sure you make yourself familiar with people and numbers that are the most helpful to you. For example, freshman advisers and financial aid office employees are the most important to familiarize yourself with.

Classes are being taken off and availability is less. Teachers in certain programs are being let go, and only the difficult(personality, not by material) ones seem to be left. I think there should be improvement in the library... it looks old. There are many places to study, one must simply find there nook which they deem comfortable., 6974=FAU is the perfect mix of learning and fun. We all have to be responsible for getting ourselves to class and absorb and retain the days lessons. When the classes are done, however, the fun begins. Dorm life is awesome and there√¢¬Ä¬ôs plenty to do around here. The students are friendly and fun-loving. We all take care of each other and are a close-knit community. The professors seem to enjoy their work and are very helpful. The gym is free and open until late so even those of us who work can get our workouts in. The cafeteria services are great; the food is fresh and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs open until about 10:30 pm for dinner, which means we can still get real food instead of cold, pre-packaged sandwiches or snacks from our dorms. We have our own little town on campus with many conveniences--yes, even a fast-food court for those who miss being back home. When we went to get out, though, the big city is just a street light away with hordes of activities and amenities, including some of the most beautiful beaches., 938140=Plenty of scholarships, they gave me 1000 dollars for summer classes just because I answered some questions early. Not too expensive, and good quality., 1014528=At FAU, first time students are required to attend an orientation session that covers the length of two days. All sessions are require you to sleep overnight at the institution, except for the Early Owls orientation. When I went, we slept in Heritage Park Towers it is nice and quaint although it does not have an open common area like Indian River Towers and the new Parliament Hall opening up in Fall 2013. I myself will be staying in HPT (acronym that you will hear very often) and I find it to be reasonable for my needs.

However, most students attending FAU are local. Therefore, there is a great sense of familiarity among people throughout the campus, which makes new and current students feel comfortable and content. Faculty, administrators, and students are always very friendly, and willing to help. There are always educational events taking place, which allow all people to get even more involved with the University, and become an active college student. Am learning a lot This University has an extremely high academic level. Professors are dedicated, and provide their students with all necessary material for them to have a complete understanding of their subject. Many classes include discussions, or online sections, that are given in addition to the typical lesson, to allow students to completely comprehend all the information taught. Furthermore, numerous courses will also have specific tutoring classes, offered for free, to clarify any questions that students might develop throughout the semester.

Considering the excellent education received from this College, and the services provided by the administration and faculty, the tuition price is not too high. Nevertheless, scholarship opportunities are somewhat limited. It is not easy to obtain financial aid. Options are restricted, and the number of awards distributed is low. Am enjoying being here Florida Atlantic University is a large College, that continues to grow each year. However, most students attending FAU are local. Therefore, there is a great sense of familiarity among people throughout the campus, which makes new and current students feel comfortable and content. Faculty, administrators, and students are always very friendly, and willing to help. There are always educational events taking place, which allow all people to get even more involved with the University, and become an active college student. Am learning a lot This University has an extremely high academic level. Professors are dedicated, and provide their students with all necessary material for them to have a complete understanding of their subject. Many classes include discussions, or online sections, that are given in addition to the typical lesson, to allow students to completely comprehend all the information taught. Furthermore, numerous courses will also have specific tutoring classes, offered",True,0,0,,

There's a local sushi place that gets FLOODED with FAU students on Friday and Saturday nights. Car insurance is cheap in this city for some reason. Rent is a little ridiculous. I come from tampa, and I could get a beautiful remodeled apartment for $750. $750 in Boca Raton is the hood. I mean not a nice area at all. Your average 1 bedroom in a nice area can run from $850 to over $1000. Get a roommate., 1082145=A myriad of food choices (including starbucks and einstein bagels!) on campus but make sure you eat at a decent hour. If you have night classes (from 4:30 and on) the food stores will be closed. If they do close, there's a lot to eat within a 1-2 mile radius including, but not limited to, jamba juice, moe's, cheesecake factory, and another starbucks!, 338030=There has never been a time where I feel unsafe on campus, even when I am walking across campus at 11:30 PM after work. For those who do not want to walk because they feel unsafe, we have NightOwls, a free golfcart service that runs all over campus on weeknights until 11:30 PM. There are also the yellow poles placed everywhere on campus that have emergency buttons that contact the police. They will send a unit out to your exact location., 746914=The campus is extremely safe, we have a police station both on campus, and literally across the street. There are lights, and emergency phones peppered throughout the campus to prevent and reassure people who may be going that extra mile with the class going past 9:00, or coming back from the library, gym, etc. The students are incredibly considerate of one another's belongings and I can personally say I have never witnessed a theft, despite dropping my wallet on the ground, leaving my car unlocked, leaving my room unlocked and all the risky behaviours advised against., 970974=Good dorms. They just built new dorms opening in fall 2013, 281595=i find the classes i am taking and have taken at fau to be challenging, depending on the subject of course. i am presently taking a spanish intermediate class and i have been learning quite a bit about latin american countries as well as very useful grammar., 1015412=If you are planning to apply or attend FAU, I suggest that you prepare ahead of time and don't miss any deadlines! For example there are scholarships that the school offers. The award of some of these scholarships is determined at the time your application is review. However, there are other scholarships that the school offers that you must apply for individually. Most of the deadlines for these scholarships is in the beginning of January , therefore apply early! In addition make sure you make yourself familiar with people and numbers that are the most helpful to you. For example, freshman advisers and financial aid office employees are the most important to familiarize yourself with. It will come in handy., 445538=I am here on scholarship, and there are still many facilities at the college that I do not use. If you do explore and take part in what the college has to offer, you may find it a good bang for your buck. Tuition goes up a lot every semester, and the addition of the new stadium for our loosing football team does not make it any better, let alone all these funding cuts of 2012. Classes are being taken off and availability is less. Teachers in certain programs are being let go, and only the difficult(personality, not by material) ones seem to be left. I think there should be improvement in the library... it looks old. There are many places to study, one must simply find there nook which they deem comfortable., 6974=FAU is the perfect mix of learning and fun. We all have to be responsible for getting ourselves to class and absorb and retain the days lessons. When the classes are done, however, the fun begins. Dorm life is awesome and there√¢¬Ä¬ôs plenty to do around here. The students are friendly and fun-loving. We all take care of each other and are a close-knit community. The professors seem to enjoy their work and are very helpful. The gym is free and open until late so even those of us who work can get our workouts in. The cafeteria services are great; the food is fresh and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs open until about 10:30 pm for dinner, which means we can still get real food instead of cold, pre-packaged sandwiches or snacks from our dorms. We have our own little town on campus with many conveniences--yes, even a fast-food court for those who miss being back home. When we went to get out, though, the big city is just a street light away with hordes of activities and amenities, including some of the most beautiful beaches., 938140=Plenty of scholarships, they gave me 1000 dollars for summer classes just because I answered some questions early. Not too expensive, and good quality., 1014528=At FAU, first time students are required to attend an orientation session that covers the length of two days. All sessions are require you to sleep overnight at the institution, except for the Early Owls orientation. When I went, we slept in Heritage Park Towers it is nice and quaint although it does not have an open common area like Indian River Towers and the new Parliament Hall opening up in Fall 2013. I myself will be staying in HPT (acronym that you will hear very often) and I find it to be reasonable for my needs.

If you're serious about getting an education and advancing your career, then challenges are going to be a welcome for you. But if you're in college to simply party, then the classes will seem like corporeal punishment."", ""GET INVOLVED! There is so much to do here at FAU. Professors and faculty will help you succeed in any endeavor if you are willing to be involved on campus academically and socially. There are so many opportunities to build yourself up not only as a student but as a leader as well. You want to make yourself stand out and by getting involved will certainly make you shine! Learn to say no. Since you will be given this new found freedom and this independence can become a double edged sword. Whether it be with the amount of credits you take, the clubs you join or the friends you make, be certain that you understand how to use the word no. Burnout is easy to develop and these are going to be the best times of your life and you don't want to risk it by taking in more than you can handle."", 'FAU is a diverse campus that is growing tremendously.

There are always educational events taking place, which allow all people to get even more involved with the University, and become an active college student. Am learning a lot This University has an extremely high academic level. Professors are dedicated, and provide their students with all necessary material for them to have a complete understanding of their subject. Many classes include discussions, or online sections, that are given in addition to the typical lesson, to allow students to completely comprehend all the information taught. Furthermore, numerous courses will also have specific tutoring classes, offered for free, to clarify any questions that students might develop throughout the semester.

If you have night classes (from 4:30 and on) the food stores will be closed.

Tuition goes up a lot every semester, and the addition of the new stadium for our loosing football team does not make it any better, let alone all these funding cuts of 2012. Classes are being taken off and availability is less. Teachers in certain programs are being let go, and only the difficult(personality, not by material) ones seem to be left. I think there should be improvement in the library... it looks old.

Dorm life is awesome and there√¢¬Ä¬ôs plenty to do around here. The students are friendly and fun-loving. We all take care of each other and are a close-knit community. The professors seem to enjoy their work and are very helpful. The gym is free and open until late so even those of us who work can get our workouts in. The cafeteria services are great; the food is fresh and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs open until about 10:30 pm for dinner, which means we can still get real food instead of cold, pre-packaged sandwiches or snacks from our dorms.

Personally though, the place to relax and have time to yourself is up in the big trees in the center of campus. There are 3 huge climbable trees that you can just lie on the branches and relax, sleep, think, paint. It probably also one of the greatest hiding places when you want to get away. There are so many branches!', 'Out of this college we have gotten students who go fresh into professional sports such as football, baseball, basketball. People who become big in businesses, they become founders, chairmen, and vice presidents of companies. Artistic students who go off and create music, become actors, singers etc. There is a lot of opportunities for anyone at FAU.', ""There is always activities to do on campus wether they are held by student government, RA's, the Greeks, or just students in general. From small art activities, to Carnivals, movie nights, DJ'ing on the patio, awareness programs, sport competitions between floors and buildings. You will never be bored, there's always a sport, artistic, creative thing to join!"", ""The cafeteria, (or what many people refer to as the Caf) always has something for everyone. They have food that they serve everyday such as in the morning omelets, cereal, eggs, waffles, bagels etc. and for lunch and dinner burgers, chicken patties, pizza, fries, salad. But they always mix it up for themes, italian one day, the next mexican, or asian. It's always great to have that variety (and you can always look online to see what they are serving for the next week.) And if going to the caf isn't your style, or you are just too lazy to walk there, then we have the convenient stores, Outtakes, on campus where you can buy a quick meal either a cold-cut sandwich or sushi, even microwavable pizza or ice cream."", ""Absolutely amazing. My first year at that school and living on campus couldn't have been better. All the RA's are so nice and friendly, you really become a family with your floor. They get you hyped up and involved so much into campus life you'll never say I have nothing to do. You meet new people, create new friendships; and it helps a lot when you need a hand with some class work, personal issues, or just trying to decide how to decorate your room. And the decorations for the floors couldn't be any cooler. Themes range from Under the Sea, to Monopoly, to Mario Cart, Despicable Me, PacMan, and even Superheroes. (It's always great to go through different buildings and floors to check out their decs.)"", ""Since this school has fairly new programs, many professors strive to get the best out of you. So expect some classes to be difficult, but there are some where it's just fun to take and the class goes by fast so don't fret on that."", ""Live on campus your first year, once you've done that you'll know this school inside out and learn a lot about what this school is all about. Also when choosing your classes--do it early and research what you need to take, and use ratemyprofessor.com it will save you."", ""Florida Atlantic University is an amazing place to create yourself and learn about things you never knew were possibly.

There's a movie theatre on campus (showing movies you've never heard of), there's the student union, the gym, the pool, long boarding on campus and volleyball court. I started in the summer term, the time when there isn't supposed to be much going on. All over campus all you see are posters to events; free ice cream, shirt making, painting owls, movie nights and free food events. It's amazing how much you will appreciate free things. Right off campus there's Boomer's (essentially a Chuck-E-Cheese for grown ups, with college nights every friday), the beautiful Atlantic Beach five minutes from campus, movies, clubs and bars.

We have department advisors for the various fields of study to help us select our classes and ensure that we are only taking classes that are necessary for our major. I know first hand how important this is because I went to a different college for my fall term and ended up having to drop a class because I was never advised that an introduction to that course was necessary, although not required. At FAU, this is standard and it helps ensure that we do not waste our time or money. The classes are challenging, yet you know there is free lab help available should you need it.

We have department advisors for the various fields of study to help us select our classes and ensure that we are only taking classes that are necessary for our major. I know first hand how important this is because I went to a different college for my fall term and ended up having to drop a class because I was never advised that an introduction to that course was necessary, although not required. At FAU, this is standard and it helps ensure that we do not waste our time or money. The classes are challenging, yet you know there is free lab help available should you need it. The professors are great at passing on their knowledge to us and they interact well with the students. The professors that I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far seem to really enjoy what they are doing and that makes for a better learning environment for us students.

Two of the living room-less halls, having a weird narrow corridor with a sink awkwardly juxtaposed in the middle. Although, the newly built Parliament Hall earns coolness points in having a frozen yogurt restaurant RIGHT INSIDE OF IT.(and just for being new).

You also don't have to make your schedule for the first semester - they do it for you. For incoming freshmen planning to live in a dorm, don't stress too much about your roommates or living situation. You'll probably be able to at least tolerate them, but most likely you'll become decent friends. If it unbearable, you can always request to move. Nothing is written in stone, there is always opportunity to change or improve. Also, make sure to go to campus events! They're a great way to meet people and make connections that can help you in the future."", 'Everyone says college will be the best time of your life, but I never realized how accurate this statement truly was until I began attending FAU.

There's the cafeteria, which includes a buffet, Coyote Jacks, Papa Johns, Chick-n-Grill, Dunkin Doughnuts, Einsteins's Bagels, Starbucks, Wendy's, and so much more. During the 2012 fall year FAU is adding Subway to the list., 183476=The dorm and meal plan requirement caused a major financial strain for me. The monthly cost ended up at around $1300 per month, which could theoretically pay for a luxury apartment or even a mortgage on a house. The school does offer scholarships to everyone who qualifies for and attends the Honors program so that helps. You can sign up for a payment plan if you can't pay a lump sum for tuition and fees., 20644=FAU itself is very reasonable. If you live off campus (which I recommend after freshmore year), do so. FAU does not charge a million different fees. The parking permits are free, but don't dare park illegally. They're too quick. Boca Raton is an expensive city - gas is expensive here (comparably), clothes and jewelry and all of that glitz is expensive. The best bang for the buck are these hole in the wall food places that immigrants own - they're the best. I don't know anyone that goes to a chain restaurant. There's a local sushi place that gets FLOODED with FAU students on Friday and Saturday nights. Car insurance is cheap in this city for some reason. Rent is a little ridiculous. I come from tampa, and I could get a beautiful remodeled apartment for $750. $750 in Boca Raton is the hood. I mean not a nice area at all. Your average 1 bedroom in a nice area can run from $850 to over $1000. Get a roommate., 1082145=A myriad of food choices (including starbucks and einstein bagels!) on campus but make sure you eat at a decent hour. If you have night classes (from 4:30 and on) the food stores will be closed. If they do close, there's a lot to eat within a 1-2 mile radius including, but not limited to, jamba juice, moe's, cheesecake factory, and another starbucks!, 338030=There has never been a time where I feel unsafe on campus, even when I am walking across campus at 11:30 PM after work. For those who do not want to walk because they feel unsafe, we have NightOwls, a free golfcart service that runs all over campus on weeknights until 11:30 PM. There are also the yellow poles placed everywhere on campus that have emergency buttons that contact the police. They will send a unit out to your exact location., 746914=The campus is extremely safe, we have a police station both on campus, and literally across the street. There are lights, and emergency phones peppered throughout the campus to prevent and reassure people who may be going that extra mile with the class going past 9:00, or coming back from the library, gym, etc. The students are incredibly considerate of one another's belongings and I can personally say I have never witnessed a theft, despite dropping my wallet on the ground, leaving my car unlocked, leaving my room unlocked and all the risky behaviours advised against., 970974=Good dorms. They just built new dorms opening in fall 2013, 281595=i find the classes i am taking and have taken at fau to be challenging, depending on the subject of course. i am presently taking a spanish intermediate class and i have been learning quite a bit about latin american countries as well as very useful grammar., 1015412=If you are planning to apply or attend FAU, I suggest that you prepare ahead of time and don't miss any deadlines! For example there are scholarships that the school offers. The award of some of these scholarships is determined at the time your application is review. However, there are other scholarships that the school offers that you must apply for individually. Most of the deadlines for these scholarships is in the beginning of January , therefore apply early! In addition make sure you make yourself familiar with people and numbers that are the most helpful to you. For example, freshman advisers and financial aid office employees are the most important to familiarize yourself with. It will come in handy., 445538=I am here on scholarship, and there are still many facilities at the college that I do not use. If you do explore and take part in what the college has to offer, you may find it a good bang for your buck. Tuition goes up a lot every semester, and the addition of the new stadium for our loosing football team does not make it any better, let alone all these funding cuts of 2012. Classes are being taken off and availability is less. Teachers in certain programs are being let go, and only the difficult(personality, not by material) ones seem to be left. I think there should be improvement in the library... it looks old. There are many places to study, one must simply find there nook which they deem comfortable., 6974=FAU is the perfect mix of learning and fun. We all have to be responsible for getting ourselves to class and absorb and retain the days lessons. When the classes are done, however, the fun begins. Dorm life is awesome and there√¢¬Ä¬ôs plenty to do around here. The students are friendly and fun-loving. We all take care of each other and are a close-knit community. The professors seem to enjoy their work and are very helpful. The gym is free and open until late so even those of us who work can get our workouts in. The cafeteria services are great; the food is fresh and it√¢¬Ä¬ôs open until about 10:30 pm for dinner, which means we can still get real food instead of cold, pre-packaged sandwiches or snacks from our dorms. We have our own little town on campus with many conveniences--yes, even a fast-food court for those who miss being back home. When we went to get out, though, the big city is just a street light away with hordes of activities and amenities, including some of the most beautiful beaches., 938140=Plenty of scholarships, they gave me 1000 dollars for summer classes just because I answered some questions early. Not too expensive, and good quality., 1014528=At FAU, first time students are required to attend an orientation session that covers the length of two days. All sessions are require you to sleep overnight at the institution, except for the Early Owls orientation. When I went, we slept in Heritage Park Towers it is nice and quaint although it does not have an open common area like Indian River Towers and the new Parliament Hall opening up in Fall 2013. I myself will be staying in HPT (acronym that you will hear very often) and I find it to be reasonable for my needs. Everyone is different and can choose whatever type of housing style they may want, just make sure to choose a living style that will make you the most comfortable.}","08/07/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 36 out of 36 people found this review useful. 1 of 315 Samantha from Coral Springs, FL Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge.

For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.', 'Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students. There are so many educational resources, student organizations, and professors with advanced degrees. UNC Charlotte is a well-run institution. The website is thorough and user-friendly.', 'The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is unfortunately attributed as a commuter school. Many UNC Charlotte students either commute back and forth to school during the week or live on or near campus and go home on the weekends. The students whom I just mentioned do not get the full college experience. There are many things for all students to experience and enjoy at UNCC both during the week and weekends. There are a plethora of student organizations with varying levels of involvement. Joining a Greek organization requires a high level of involvement; this is a great way to enhance your college experience. Many Greeks stay on campus during the weekend and are kept busy doing events such as community service, fundraisers, and enjoying the social aspect of being Greek. If joining a student organization is not in your list of to-dos do not fear! The Student Union, the newest building on campus, offers attractions for students who dare to stay on campus during the weekend. Located in the Student Union is a food court, a movie theatre (free for students) and an art gallery. Basketball, soccer and baseball are just some of the sports that have games on the weekends...(football is coming in 2010). Special events are always held on campus. You can locate complete event logistics via the UNC Charlotte website: www.uncc.edu and searching the event calendar.', ""Dear Prospective UNC Charlotte Student, This University has a wide variety of majors; some of which are known around the country for the excellent quality of their courses. Classroom settings can range from large lecture classes of 300 students to smaller and more personal classroom settings of 28 students. It is hard to say that because I am learning a lot, you will too. That in fact may not be the case if you have a differing major than I have. However, I can tell you that there are many helpful resources on campus that will aid you in your quest to excel in school. Some of the resources that are available on UNC Charlotte's campus include: Learing Communities which pair people with the same major in the same learning community. The following located in the Fretwell building: The Writing Resource Center- very helpful if you are stumped while writing a paper and need some direction. Disabilities services- for students with learning disabilities; also, math tutoring. Advising counselors that can help you with planning your schedule and personal counselors that you can talk to if you are going through a hard time. In addition to the resources mentioned in the Fretwell building, Atkins Library also provides students with scholarly assistance. If you are writing a research paper and don't know where to begin, you can live-chat with a librarian from your own computer right from home.

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', 'Students that want to submerge themselves in a diverse campus will benefit from this college. Students that are international are treated with extra care and have lots of help that is given to them. Students that major in business, education, and engineering have big departments with a wide variety of help. Students who like the city and nightlife are more than likely to prefer this campus over others in North Carolina, due to the entertainment downtown Charlotte.', ""Most tips for students would be like, go to class everyday or something of a normal sound, but I have learned a lot about campus that could really help you. 1) New incoming freshman should always live on campus! You will do better with your academics if you live on campus, provided that you are close to campus resources, peers in classes that will form study groups, and your independence will push you to do things. You meet most of your best friends freshman year as well (just remember the difference between your party friends and your school work buddies). 2) After freshman year, you have the option for Declining balance dining. This means that you won't have to pay for the freshman meals that most students don't end up using and wasting their money. Declining balance can be used for all food dining services, not just cafeteria food, and at the school Starbucks, Wendys, and Outtakes (a grocery store). If you find yourself eating more at these dining services or not eating at the school at all, declining balance saves you money. 3) Read the housing contract before you sign it! All UNC housing system goes like this: you sign the housing contract way before you even move in, and you are also rushed into choosing housing. Freshman get it bad, since you have last choice on housing. Try not to get highrises, but suitestyle living or apt living. The most popular choices are: Witherspoon, Lynch, and Laurel Hall. If you want to move out last minute, housing WILL charge you $750, even if there is no damages and you didn't even move in. So make sure you look at the floor plans ahead of time, maybe see friend's rooms, and decide ahead of time what you want and have backups before you tell them your housing options."", ""I think Charlotte is definitely a great college and it's worth every penny when it comes to academics and professors. All of the professors I've had so far are very helpful, and make learning fun. They know how to do their job and are enthusiastic about their teachings. Many professors are very helpful when it comes to recommending career choices as well and helping you find out ways to get there. The food is worth it, sometimes the home cooking at the cafeteria comes up with an interesting combination of foods that most students enjoy. Although I prefer to cook my own foods shopping from Walmart which is nearby. The housing on campus, is liveable. Not the nicest rooms or cheapest, but they are clean and give you options for changing rooms halfway throughout the year. Parking is very expensive and you aren't guaranteed a specific parking space, so you better get to your spots early enough!"", ""Because of it's lively atmosphere, Charlotte makes a great place for students to have a good medium of both worlds: the study world, and the entertainment world. Downtown Charlotte makes for a great get away on the weekends with its number in clubs and restaurants. While the Atkins Library and Ritazza Cafe makes a good place to have a quiet study and a snack. The new Student Union that was built this previous summer, allows for students to relax on their comfy chairs and communicate with one another."", 'With the diversity of the campus I am learning a lot about different cultures, perceptions, and backgrounds. Being that my major is International Studies with a minor in Spanish, I like to surround myself with students from different countries. I learn how to better my Korean language, share ideas and cultures, and be apart of some great foreign foods!']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1966,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00223-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911589927,911426427,HORIZONTAL,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

It isn't the most delicious, but it will serve the purpose of filling you up. There are healthy choices and usually an area for vegetarians. You can usually never go wrong with pizza or burgers."", ""Dorm life is a wonderful learning experience. There is no one telling you to clean up or to give you a curfew. But a major part that high school students aren't aware of is the growing experience. College students are forced to be in close quarters with a person they have never met before and that can be very challenging. You find out a lot about yourself and your preferences which will help you later on in life. You also learn to compromise because both of you are equally entitled the room/suite and all of its amenities."", ""When you coming into the college atmosphere, do so with this in mind; One of your needs is going to have to be altered. I feel that as a college student three things are necessary those things beign sleep, studying, and a social life. But if you're only focused with your social life and sleep, then you won't have much time for studying. If you are only concerened studying and sleep, then you won't really have a social life. College is all about balance and once you have mastered that your grades will reflect it."", 'Safety would probably be the biggest issue here. Make sure you are aware of your surroundings at all times and be mindful of your belongings. Also, take the time to make connections with people. Have genuine conversations with people whether they are a janitor of the chancellor.

The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.",True,0,0,,

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life.

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

I can admit that the material can be very boring and hard to understand but the professors that I had have made it interesting. I have had some professors that are strict on grades but I also have had professors that are not so much about giving a grade but making the student understand all the material as best as they can. It was really interesting to get a variety of teachers with very different opinions about school. In high school, I had a very generic set of teachers who only taught what the county gave them to teach and it was very boring. In college, my professors actually went beyond and related the topics to stundents. For example, I had a liberal studies class about theater and society. My professor related the two topics to things that are highly regarded in this generation like celebrities and technology.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1966,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,11,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00223-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911589927,911426427,HORIZONTAL,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull. The general education classes can be a pain but the more specialized your classes become the better the teachers become. Login to rate or flag the reviews Nicole from Waxhaw, NC",True,0,0,,

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

For those students who have other interests, however, (and I am one) I would say the student that cannot afford to go to the more expensive universities but desires a quality education should come to UNCC, as the education there is in many ways just as good as many more prominent universities. In closing, I believe that those students who are looking for a good college at a reasonable price and who desire to get involved with and take advantage of the college life will have a great experience at UNCC.', 'The biggest adjustment for incoming freshman at any college is adjusting to life on their own with the pressures of academic work. The best advice I can give is to be serious about your work and to give it your best effort, because there is no replacement for good grades, and you never know when you might need them in the future. If you struggle, ask questions. The professors are there for you, not vice versa, so take advantage of them as much as you can. The second thing I would say is to become involved in campus activities such as religious organizations, intramurals, student government, and other things. Schoolwork comes first, but to remain sane one must have a social life, and one of the best ways to do this is to become involved in and know about campus activities.', 'In comparison to many other collegiate universities, UNCC is an extremely reasonably-priced institution, and, for the quality of education it offers, is an excellent choice to consider for in-state students who desire to go to a quality university for a good price. This is not to say that out-of-state students should not come as well; however, the main attraction UNCC holds is its pull toward especially those in-state students interested in architecture, engineering, and business.', 'I initially did not want to attend UNCC for the simple reason that it was too close to home, but since I have been there I have come to appreciate and enjoy it in a much fuller and deeper way than I initially thought was possible. Contrary to what I had at first thought, UNCC has been the ideal place for me to continue my post-high school graduation, and I look forward to completing the remainder of my undergraduate studies there.', 'Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal.

The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte.

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more!

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes.

However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible.

If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The book store does have a clearance section that you can find school gear at decent prices though there are local vendors that sell school gear, right across the street, at really good prices (Grey's book store is a great location)."", 'The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is a great location because we have Concord Mills mall, 10 minutes north, and downtown Charlotte, 10 minutes south. At the Student Union building on campus we have our own movie theater, free for students, that is awesome to go to and there are also pool tables and weekly activities in this building for students such as competitions and such. There is also the Greenway that runs right through campus and around Charlotte that offers students a great way to exercise or just to go for a walk on around campus. Tennis courts are also available for students to play on (I have done so many times). For people of drinking age, there are plenty of chill bars to go to close to campus to go out with friends to.', ""I believe that our school has an excellent variety of dining options. Dining plans are offered so that you don't have to carry change with you and you can just use your student card. Our campus has local vendors such as Wendy's, Mama Leon's, Einstein's Bagels, Bojangles and Chik-fil-a. There are also two cafeteria locations to eat at."", ""There are a lot more on campus living options now than when I first came to this school. Of course the newer buildings are nicer looking than the older ones. I've known people that usually made life long friends with the people they met through dorm life at this school and people that have also learned important social skills because of living with different people."", 'They offer a great array of different classes. I am part of the Languages department and I know from personal experience that they do try and help you with your classes. Though you have to prepare to plan your class schedule ahead of time because there are classes only offered in the Fall or Spring semesters so if one is not careful they could get behind a semester or two for not planning correctly. Signing up on time for a class is crucial, especially if you are at a higher level class since there is probably only one class offered for each section.', ""Make sure you plan your class schedule ahead of registration time so that you can register for classes right off the bat and avoid the chance of it getting filled. Also, keep in mind the location of the classes you are choosing to make sure you have time to walk to each class. If you plan to commute to campus, make sure you give yourself an hours amount of spare time to find parking since, especially during the first and last two weeks of school can be hectic and spaces hard to find. Also, you might want to look into off-campus parking to avoid the high price for the parking sticker. If you love sports, make sure you get involved in Niner Nation Gold. This is an exceptional student organization that is dedicated to school spirit and emphasizes students involvement in sporting events. Plus the atmosphere at the games you get is pretty stellar! Find and join any student clubs or organizations that seem interesting to you, it is the best way to meet people, especially if you come from a private school or out of state. If you don't have a lot of money, or are a broke student like myself, save yourself some money by bringing your own snacks/lunches on campus; there is good food here on campus but it can get pricey. It's an amazing school and has a great campus, remember to enjoy they time you have here!"", 'The University of North Carolina has a great student body with school spirit. This University is composed of an impressive mix of different cultures and ethnicity. The campus offers different social societies and clubs for students to get involved in and since the campus is about three miles in width, it offers great exercise opportunities.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1966,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,76,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00223-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911589927,911426427,HORIZONTAL,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Dorms suck pretty bad, I've visited friends in the High Rises, looks like the last time that building wasn't grey and depressing was before they built it. Many dorms don't have cell phone service, so that is pretty fun. All the people usually go home on the weekends, making dorm life pretty boring.

Understand the information and make sure you can do some of the sample problems. If there aren't any problems assigned, you should still look into the sample problems from the book. Sleep is important. Your roommates in your dorm will probably be up all night and making noise, so don't be afraid to invest in some husqvarna hearing protection. Finally, GO TO CLASS. You're paying a lot of money to have your classes, even if you don't feel you get anything out of the class, you're likely not to look over the information otherwise. Also, go ahead and challenge yourself. Get more than 15 credit hours, it all costs the same and it will save you time in the end."", ""The college is a good strong step up from community colleges, and also a good fallback if you don't get into NCState or Chapel Hill.

The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull. The general education classes can be a pain but the more specialized your classes become the better the teachers become. Login to rate or flag the reviews Nicole from Waxhaw,",True,0,0,,

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more!

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

You can join clubs that suit your interests including sports, arts, etc. There is a movie theater in the student union that you and your friends can go to and watch the latest movies. You can also go to sports games which is another great environment to meet knew people , support your school and have a good time. Overall the amount of fun you can have depends on the student.', ""Personally I do not know what opinion I should give others on the food and dining. I think the main dining facility is exceptional. It is called the Student Union. You have a number of options from fast-food like Wendy's and Chick Fil A to eating in the cafeteria. Food and dinging depends on your individual preference. You can have a meal plan that gives you access to a certain amount of meals per week in the cafeteria. In addition their is a declining balance system that you can use to purchase fast-food if the cafeteria food is not to your liking. You could even do both."", 'Dorm life is in all honesty what you make it out to be. Try to get to know others where ever your staying at, especially your roommates. Treat others how you would want to be treated and I guarantee that you will be fine.', 'I would not say that UNC Charlotte is not any more or less difficult academically than other colleges. The main thing is you have to be on top of the work that is given. This includes incoming projects, homework assignments, tests. Procrastination can make college in terms of academics difficult than it should not be.', 'There are a number of after-school programs to help incoming students improve there performance in the classroom. Try to take advantage of as many of these programs as possible. College is different from high school in number of ways. The main difference is the freedom that one is given tends to make some students deviate from whats truly important. This important aspect of going to college should be completing your degree. On the other hand try to have a fun experience. College is not all about studying every minute. You should try to join clubs if possible and make it a priority to make friends.', 'UNC Charlotte is a peaceful environment where you as a student can take your learning to the next level. The students as well as the teachers going off of my experience are friendly. The campus is beautiful and there are a number of after-school activities to do.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1966,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,89,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00223-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911589927,911426427,HORIZONTAL,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes.

Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great!

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.",True,0,0,,

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus.

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural).

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home.

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

Even later in the after noon, there's tons of lighting and even PATS safe ride. If you ever feel cautious, there are plent of poles with blue lights around campus. There, you just push a button and a driver will come to you and take you either back to your dorm, or to where ever you parked for the day. And there's always the UNC police around campus for extra safety when required."", ""If you are accepted to UNCC. You will be required to attend the SOAR orientation. Don't worry! It's actually a wonderful experience to meet incoming freshman or incoming transfers.

It's very fun!"", ""Amazing for commuter students. With classes going on from 8AM to 9PM, there's plenty to choose from, so there's no worry if you need to work. I myself, am a full time student but only drive to school two days a week. I love it because I save on gas, and have more time through out the week to get my homework done. But always remember, school comes first! Don't feel pressured to pick a class because of what time it is, each class is different, even if they have the same name. The campus even offers a rate you professor so you can have a glimpse of what it may be like."", 'No heart-attack potential here!

If you are undecided about what you're in the mood for, no worries. From Bojangles to Chick-fil-A, to Wendy's to Starbucks.

There's no end to what you can try."", ""Many, many options for Freshman - Seniors, to the Greek students, private to co-ed. There's no such thing as shoe box, moldy dorms here!

Actually, the professors do, and all of my professors take attendance everyday. They want you to be there. And there is more to class than just memorizing notes, dates and names. The professors want you and everyone to engage in group discussions, so everyone can be involved. They want you to do well. They have even been tests that I never even wrote notes down because of our discussions, and I didn't even need them, because I understood everything after we talked about whatever lesson of they day it was. All professors are willing to go out of their way to give extra help if you don't understand something. Some even gave myself and my classmates their cell, and home phone numbers!

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college.

The student union tries to put on functions but most of them remind me of girl scout camp. There is a religious guy who stands at the tower in the spring to remind students of their pathway to hell...that can be interesting for a few minutes.', 'Chartwells...what more can I say. Food service quality and gourmet prices. The single source food contract has left students with few options (all overpriced). However, the Indian buffet across the street is cheap and rocks.', 'If there is one it is only because the campus has no life leaving students in their dorms when escape is not an option.', 'You can find rigorous classes however the students complain so much most professors are forced to curve the grades beyond any reasonable measure.', 'Be aware of your surroundings! Security is light and you are pretty much on your own. Do not trust the advising staff. You can be told 3 different things by 3 different counselors. Go to the department and find out what you will need to graduate! The area around campus is pretty much the ghetto. Besides the danger factor, there are no 24 hour coffee shops or groovy little diners for stimulating conversation and the closest cultural experience not related to gang activity would be found downtown. Just be prepared to make the best out of it...', 'UNCC is a fairly impersonal university and can feel a bit like extended community college. If you work very hard to cultivate relationships with professors, there are opportunities but with large classes sizes and harried departments this is completely up to you. For students entering criminal justice, primary education or any of the government type careers--this is the perfect university.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1966,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,123,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00223-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911589927,911426427,HORIZONTAL,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students. There are so many educational resources, student organizations, and professors with advanced degrees. UNC Charlotte is a well-run institution. The website is thorough and user-friendly.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

And we have over 10 fast food/gourmet options like sushi, bojangles, wendy's, chik-fil-a, fiesty's franks and fries, and salsarita's.

Our dorms are nice and the RA's of every building try to get the students involved with free food and awesome activities throughout the entire year. Living on campus is great."", ""Many classes in the science departments, especially the intro classes for chemistry and biology, are alot harder because the classes are so large and they tend to be weed out classes so that there are a small amount of dedicated students in the upper level classes. Don't let this get you down, study hard and GO TO CLASS and tutoring if need be. Our Nursing Program is number 3 in the country for all you intended nursing majors so that means it's hard, just do your best. Our LBST classes, which every has to take are usually easy A's so MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A's in these classes, they're easy so why not? Overall, most gen-ed courses are a mix or easy and tough classes but make sure you strive for A's while you can, because it's hard to get your GPA up to par as a junior or senior."", ""-Apply early! Don't wait until the last minute to apply because with a 25,000 and growing student population, we run out of housing QUICKLY. -Take AP exams if you can, it'll help you progress in a difficult major quickly and make sure you graduate on time while leaving you some wiggle room to take interesting elective courses. -Don't be afraid to explore campus BEFORE you apply and maybe try and spend a weekend there..many students apply and get on campus only to find out that it's not the right fit. -Research scholarships ahead of time, UNCC gives out it's school scholarships in the financial aid package you receive so there is no application process..which means if you need more money, you'l have to find it on your own -And lastly, don't be afraid to talk to the head of the department for your major. They're really nice people and can offer you advice on courses to take, internship opportunities, scholarships, and they're just generally great people to talk to. They've been through the schooling and coursework already so they'll understand the ups and downs of your major."", ""UNC Charlotte is not only a great school for commuter students, but it caters specifically to one of the most diverse student bodies in the entire UNC school system.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am.

If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull. The general education classes can be a pain but the more specialized your classes become the better the teachers become. Login to rate or flag the reviews Nicole from Waxhaw,",True,0,0,,

The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life.

Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes.

Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am.

If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes.

Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students.

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull. The general education classes can be a pain but the more specialized your classes become the better the teachers become.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus.

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

They offer the best honors programs, leadership organizations, sports clubs, Christian organizations, and anything else you can think of! There is always something to do on campus and usually hosted by some club. In the first week of school they have a club fair that introduces students to all of the clubs and organizations on campus. I highly recommend you check that out!', ""UNC Charlotte is great for students who want the big campus feel but the small campus community. When I walk around campus, I see at least one person I know every day. Also, UNC Charlotte is very diverse. There is a wide range of students that goes from greeks to book worms, hipsters to jocks, and American to international students. It's really a campus for everyone who just wants a great education, awesome friends, and a fun college experience."", 'I do not know of any unusual traditions or locations on campus.', ""UNC Charlotte is a steal for North Carolina residents. The education is great, there is lots to do, the campus is beautiful, and it's affordable! Choosing this school has been one of my greatest decisions."", ""Going to a game is a must! Especially since football is coming this fall, there will always be something fun to do. The Student Union has a movie theater that plays new movies every Thursday-Saturday night. They also have a lounge where you can hang out and play pool. A lot of students like to go to NoDa which is the artsy district of Charlotte. They have great restaurants, a cute coffee shop, a French bakery called Amalie's, and a music lounge called The Evening Muse. It is a ten minute drive from campus and a must for study dates or a fun night out."", ""There are a lot of places to choose from across campus and the food is pretty good. Crown Commons is in the Student Union and it offers food ranging from salads to cheeseburgers to tofu stir fry. They have specials everyday but always have the salad bar and the sandwich and pizza stations. There's always a place to eat wherever you are on campus. There is a Bojangles, Chick-fil-a, and Salsarita's as well."", ""If you really want to get to know people, live in the high rises. The living isn't as great but you'll definitely make friends! Most of the other dorms have a great community to them, have at least one kitchen and laundry room on every floor, and they are close to your classes. Overall, the housing is great on this campus."", 'I am in the Business school and the classes are definitely challenging. Although there is a lot of work, the professors are great and they push you to do your best. All the hard work will pay off!!', ""As soon as you get on campus join at least two organizations. It is such a great way to meet new people, gain experience, and add to your college experience. Also, don't be afraid to talk to your professors! Getting to know them is important because they have the power to add a few points to your final grade. It can be the difference between passing and failing!"", 'UNC Charlotte is a beautiful campus that is large enough to have a big college feel but also small enough that you get to know a lot of other students. I love being a student here because of the different organizations, athletics, and great professors.

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

There is many options to choose, from fast food to buffets.', 'Never lived in a dorm but my friends seemed to enjoy it a lot.', 'It is a hard school, may not be recognized as one of the top schools, but do not let that fool you. Its large classes make it hard to get one on one help unless you visit your professors office outside of class. It is very challenging but you will learn as long as you put in the time and effort to do so.', 'Stay on track and make sure that you do your work. You may not feel the need to study everyday, but if you get behind it will be hard to catch up. Make friends within your major and create study groups. Get to know your professors by going to their office and introducing yourself. The more people you know the better.', 'UNCC is a challenging school; however, most of the professors are great and willing to help any of their students. Besides academics, UNCC has amazing views, from the flower garden to the view of the city.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here!

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are likeÏU<á–M÷ÕÙ{ˆì∫Cè_˚àR¬ %Ú@√-¡∫Ì a tracking device.

Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here!

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The student union is probably the best place to go, because it offers Crown Commons (buffet style), Wendys, Mama Leons, and a Bistro. When i was a freshman i would probably say i ate at crown commons the most, because you pay with your meal swipes, and you get to eat however much you want. Plus they have breakfast, lunch, and dinner in which the food is never the same thing everyday. The Bistro is a more fancy type of eat in place which has really good food as well, and you can also use your meal swipes there too. The other places of interest that UNCC has to offer is a Chik Fila, Bojangles, Subway, Salsaritas, and Grill Nation. Students have the option to use meal plans or declining balance.

Each professor has a strong desire in teaching to their students the knowledge they have gained over their lifetime. Not only will you look up to these teachers for advice, but once you get to know them they also will become like a friend to you.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more!

It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

The campus has its own police force and emergency alarms along isolated paths if someone feels threatened. I very rarely get reports about violent acts on campus. Those in the campus community are generally friendly as well. We are all family here and look out for each other. I cannot think of an instance where I have been harassed on campus. I feel right at home on campus. I feel safe.', 'I am not part of Greek Life, but from all the tables and signs set up, there are plenty of options for joining one of these communities.', 'See the above What to do for fun section.', 'This college is great for all types of students. Most commonly I meet transfer students or foreign exchange students. The distribution of students is high, I never feel like there is an abnormally large amount of one race or gender.', 'Visit the tenth floor of the library some time. That is where the antique writings are kept, so it would be neat to explore those. The ladies up there will gladly give a tour of their collection. It is also a nice, peaceful location with an incredible view. Perfect place to study.', 'Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype.', 'UNCC has some 350 clubs and organizations on campus. There are plenty of events happening on campus at all times, from charity events, to games, intramural sports, and parties. Sports are big part of campus as well. Recently, the university has acquired a football team, helping to put it on the map. Game days are always fun and sociable occasions. There is also a large presence of the arts, with exhibitions of art and music constantly rotating in from the greater Charlotte area. Orchestral concerts and dance recitals are fun to experience, as well as plays and musicals that show in the art halls. Outside of campus, there is tons to do. East down 49 is the town of Harrisburg, with lots of places to eat and hang out. Heading west down west on North Tryon Street will take you directly into Charlotte, where many fun activities wait to be explored. All that is required is a little digging to find what you might be interested in.', ""I ate well at UNCC. There are 5 or 6 dining areas on campus I believe, all of which serve quality food. Besides the official dining halls, there are a wide variety of third party restaurants on campus like Wendy's, Chick-fil-a, Salsarita's, Subway, and Bojangles. There is a wide variety of cultural food options also, like Japanese or Middle Eastern. You won't go hungry on campus. There are also plenty of options for the all important coffee to help us grind through the day."", ""I commuted off campus my first semester, but my friends tell me that living on campus is a blast, so I'll take their word for it."", 'Courses can range from incredibly easy to stupid hard. It all depends on your major and the professor you take. Research your professors before you sign up for courses. If you have an awesome professor, even if the course material is hard to grasp, they will help you to succeed the best they can. I found myself overwhelmed at times by the amount of work present, but I had good professors who were willing to hep me excel in the course. Remember to pace yourself, and you should be able to tackle whatever work a class throws at you.', 'Make sure to attend class when ever you can. You will see a definite positive difference in your GPA if you do. Do all of your homework. In College, you teach yourself most of the time through the text books and home works. Doing the home work will help to master the material in preparation for exams. Finally, practice time management skills. Work loads can get big fast. Be sure to be responsible and stay on top of your course load. These tips can and will help you to succeed in your first semester of college.', 'UNCC is a great campus filled with a diverse population of cultures from around America and world. It is a medium size, with the full college experience, but not so big as to overwhelm an incoming student. UNCC is a young school that is growing fast, inviting the all to receive a quality education without breaking the bank.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/1966,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,204,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00223-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,911589927,911426427,HORIZONTAL,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday.

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

Since the student body is so large, there is an organization for almost every field that you could think of.

Though the school is large, if a student is ready to embrace their education and take it into their own hands, they can easily find success.

It does require students to take their own initiative (largely because of its size), but a successful student will have no problem taking advantage of the many opportunities it has to offer.', 'One of the greatest advantages of being in Charlotte is the wide variety of entertainment options that the city offers.

I do know that the buildings (both residential and academic) are all either newly built or renovated, and that many students have a positive experience bonding with their peers in the dorms, especially in their early years here. I have had a positive experience living in an apartment off campus, and plan to continue doing so next year. Since the Charlotte area is so large it is not difficult to find affordable housing."", 'The classes at UNCC vary in rigor based on subject matter. While some courses require less time and dedication, the classes offered in the fields of math and science are very work-intensive and require significant amounts of time outside of class for both homework and studying. Do NOT underestimate the rigor of tests--there are often fewer grades in courses so your exam and paper grades may ultimately determine how well you do in the course.', ""In order to excel at UNCC (or any other university), it's important to be ahead in your classwork. If you're still in high school, do everything you can to challenge yourself academically and excel where you can. Make sure you come and visit the campus when applying in order to make sure that it is the right place for you."", ""The University of North Carolina at Charlotte offers challenging academic courses in a variety of subject areas.

The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}","06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living.
