The campus is open 24 hours and there is always a security guard or two around.', 'There are not too many clubs at Otis because the students are so busy with school assignments and jobs but there are several activities and celebrations at Otis every month.', 'One interesting tradition at Otis is the cube project in Form and Space class during Foundation year. Each wave of students has to build a cube from paper, one from cardboard, and a pyramid from foam board. Another interesting tradition is the socratic seminar with Michael Schrier at Los Angeles County Museum of Art. One of my favorite traditions was in the Life Drawing course, we compared our first day drawings with our last day drawings. That was definitely a day full of laughs.', 'Most things in the cafeteria are over-priced but I often get a cup of rice which has carrots, peas, and other veggies in it with salsa on top for only $2.00. The best deal on campus. Also sometimes art supply stores come set up and sell discounted merchandise to the students, occasionally even giving things away for free.', 'There is a bowling alley right next to the campus but as far as on campus fun, Otis often has visiting artist lectures, gallery openings and exhibits, field trips, and other various events for students to enjoy. During finals week, the school provides dinner to any student who comes to claim it which is a major perk during the most stressful time of the year.', ""Although there are many options in the cafeteria, including vegetarian and gluten free alternatives, the overall quality is simply mediocre and the price is extremely high. I would recommend dining elsewhere like the beautiful farmer's market across the street in the park every Wednesday."", 'The dorm living is certainly one of the most glamorous aspects of freshman year at Otis. Four students live together in the beautiful Playa Del Oro apartment complex in a spacious two-bedroom unit. The amenities include a pool, sauna, hot tub, grills, work out area, computer room, and entertainment area. It is just a block from the main campus with everything a person could need in walking distance.', 'Not only is the artistic pursuit at this school at a very high level but the liberal arts classes are also intellectually challenging. The students are reacquired to take art history classes each year while in school along with English and writing courses and a math course. The combination of traditional and experimental drawing courses, digital courses, and 3-dimensional sculpting classes makes for a well-rounded education.', ""Foundation year may seem kind of frightening from a perspective student's point of view, but the level of information you will retain and use for the rest of your life is not comparable to any experience I have ever had before. I would recommend keeping an open mind and having a very detailed schedule in order to manage your time most effectively as to not get overwhelmed by the heavy workload."", 'Otis is a perfect place for anyone interested in making his or her artistic pursuits a full-time professional career. The students are determined, talented, creative individuals who have the opportunity to learn everything about the basics of art and beyond from some of the best teachers in the world. All in all, the level of education available at Otis College of Art and Design is one of the best artistically in the country.']]",Otis College of Art and Design Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Otis-College-of-Art-and-Design/reviews,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,7,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00138-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903447731,903416867,HORIZONTAL,"07/16/2012 Reviewer is A current student here. 10 out of 10 people found this review useful. 1 of 27 Hi from Los Angeles, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

You will be automatically registered for your classes and you will be with other students for your major. If you end up with a roommate you just can't live with, don't panic! Just talk to housing and you'll be able to move by the end of the week. (It was one of the best decisions of my life!) Everybody likes to complain about the food at Gracie's but I think it's delicious! Always eat at Mongo's! Can't find the energy to wake up for lunch? No problem! Ask your professor if you can eat in his/her class. I saved tons of time by enjoying my food while learning. If you're having a tough time with your math homework, there is free tutoring always available. A writing lab will also help review your papers and essays as well. Didn't get the professor you wanted? Just email them! Most professors are willing to overfill their classrooms so that you don't have to suffer through a quarter with a poor teacher. If you need anything else, just ask your RA, your academic adviser or even President Destler. All of these resources are bound to know how to answer your inquiries. Finally, stay organized! RIT's quarter system moves fast and if you fall behind, you'll get buried with work in no time. Make friends and work together to get through your classes with A's! (But don't overwork yourself. There is plenty of time for relaxing and spending time doing whatever you want.)"", 'RIT is very expensive because of the immense amount of things going on.

In the Fall of 2013, the school will be making a switch to semesters. Classes with still be challenging and useful, just longer., 501774=There are alot of demands for other classes that is needed to graduate with a degree such as taking Liberal Arts. Including that with the courses with majors, the work is stressful depending on the courses or the amount is taken. With the Conversion Term to now Semesters. In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be.

The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"
"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', 'Overall, yes this is a great college and you can do well in whatever you chose to do here academically. However, students who want to succeed here also need to be dedicated workers and dedicated to doing well. You can have the best intentions and procrastinate and then go out with your friends more and more frequently but then before you know it you√¢\x80\x99re one of those students that can√¢\x80\x99t make it as easy as the other students are. The last thing you want to be your year is to become a slacker and with all of the amazing opportunity that this college provides who would want to waste it!', 'Tips, Tip number one. Talk to your academic advisor and see what you can do to make it so you√¢\x80\x99re in a learning community. It makes the first couple weeks a lot more bearable and throughout the year it√¢\x80\x99s very comforting to know and useful to have people you can talk to about work close by. It√¢\x80\x99s a big help too with last minute work, you tend to run into a lot of that with these quarter systems because everything winds up flying by so fast. Tip number two. Keep up with homework, it is all very important and is all on the very large tests you get at the end of each unit. Also, do well on your tests and actually study for them. If you have like three of four of them and you know how you√¢\x80\x99ve done on each then you pretty much know how you√¢\x80\x99re doing in that class. Tip number three. Keep in touch with your academic advisor and up to date on everything academically, financially, look to the future and anticipate things. Even talk to your FYE instructor and other teachers out of the class room on more than one occasion, they know what they√¢\x80\x99re talking about and have lots of advice to share. Tip number three. Have fun :) The year is challenging but RIT does such an awesome job of arranging activities for you! I know I had a great time at Brick City and the many hockey games I attended. Those were my favorite, find some time to get out and support the team! Barbeques and fraternity pool parties, blow-up wrestling on the quarter mile and special dinners at Gracies are some of the things I enjoyed my first quarter and it just keeps coming!', 'Ah, right. There is a twist to its satisfying atmosphere. RIT is a private school and tends to be very expensive. You do find those students and friends who don√¢\x80\x99t seem to have a problem with the financial burden but for people like me who are about average and need to worry about the financials a lot when attending a private school I would recommend signing up for as many scholarships as possible!! The money is out there you just need to apply yourself. Talk to financial aid! They will always think in your best interest and help you as much as they can, even if it√¢\x80\x99s suggesting to you what the best websites are for finding scholarships. Also, work study is always a good way to go. Everyone on campus is very friendly and helpful with new students who are just getting a start on working so don√¢\x80\x99t be afraid to look into it. The RIT website can help a lot with that. If you find this is really the school you want to go to, work something out, there is always a way, even if it means waiting until after graduation day with those loans. After graduation though hopefully it will be less of a burden for you with RIT√¢\x80\x99s above average rate of helping students to land jobs, sometimes even before graduation!', 'When I started my college search the two qualifications that I always had to look into before I considered anyplace were the schools academics and their campus. The academics obviously because you want to make sure they provide your major but also the campus because you want to make sure you√¢\x80\x99re going to be comfortable, happy and safe living there. I really am enjoying my time here because the campus is beautiful, the area is amazing and I feel one hundred percent safe in my dormitory and on the campus itself. Comfort is a big thing for me and so far I haven√¢\x80\x99t found any reason to complain. I really am enjoying myself here at RIT, the dorms and the people in them are so much fun and friendly and its overall just such a rewarding experience.', 'I stated school at RIT in September, 2008.

Don't be like me- 12 straight hours on a project due the next day- get your work done ahead of time.

Make sure to bring warm clothes too!"", ""RIT is pretty pricey, and even though art students don't have books, we do have art supplies (NOT CHEAP). The classes are challenging, even though we get the stereotype of just an art student, and all we have to do is draw pictures. People just don't understand, while you are doing your web-assign, I am spending days on a project for one class. Even with all that work, it's graded on how well the teacher likes it, is it visually appealing? Does it keep interest? Is it too busy? Teachers are tough, but it just gives you the incentive to do better."", ""College is so much fun. I spend most of my time with my friends in Sol and when were not doing homework, were goofing off! If we can't find something to do on campus- exercise facility, ice rink, weight room, climbing center, dances- there's things off campus that aren't that far away, like the movie theaters, Blue Cross Arena, Dinosaur Barbeque, Strong Museum of Play, etc. I saw two shows t the Blue Cross Arena, Cirque Du Soleil and the Transiberian Orchestra, both of which I got discounted tickets for being a student."", ""I am an art major and I was intimidated when I started here. I didn't have experience in all medias and I was afraid that it would leave me behind, but the teachers understand and are willing to take time out of their schedule to help me better understand the media I am using. Students are also willing to help if you ask. The teachers there are great and truly know what they are teaching. I have learned so much just in one quarter, it's amazing. When I started, I had no experience in figure drawing, but now I really understand the body and can pick out what I'm doing wrong and know how to fix it.""]]",Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Rochester-Institute-of-Technology/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/18458,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,4,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00138-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903596211,903448141,HORIZONTAL,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 36 out of 36 people found this review useful. 1 of 154 Geoff from Avon, NY Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

What that means is that if your major requires a co-op, there's opportunity to do that in the summer. It also means that we have a very fast paced, rigorous curriculum - we're squeezing a semester's amount of work into 10 weeks. However, classes are over with faster, it's changing before you get too bored, and because there's so much packed in, you're more or less employable by the end of your second year (depending on your major). Come and take a tour! Yes, there's a lot (A LOT) of bricks, but check out what will be your building for classes, and the dorms. Once you're here, get out of the dorms! Go to events, meet the people from your major - those are the people you'll be having class with. Become friends with someone with a car and get off campus (Buffalo Wild Wings - or B Dubs, Chipotle, The Marketplace Mall, Tilt Night Club, Barnes and Noble... they're all right down the street! Take advantage!) Get a laptop - the entire campus is wireless! You can sit outside your classroom, in the tunnels below the dorms (that's where the laundry rooms, the post office, and a couple convenience stores are), in one of the quads, in class, in your dorm, probably even one of the elevators, and you will have a connection. Cell phones are also a must. Texting mostly."", ""RIT prepares you for a career, they don't just teach you stuff that you'll never use.

Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"
"[['Categories', 'Great for these types of students', 'Tips for prospective students', 'Bang for the buck', 'Am enjoying being here', 'Am learning a lot'], ['Comments', ""RIT has such a diverse community that you can't go wrong. There's a strong foreign student presence, which is never a bad thing. RIT has sister campuses in Croatia, the Dominican Republic, Kosovo, and Dubai, India, so many of the foreign students are from those regions, but there are plenty of others! I had a friend last year dating a guy from Italy. If you're looking to study abroad, then has RIT got the program for you! All those sister campuses offer classes that you can take if you choose to attend said school, along with of course just plain study abroad opportunities. I have my eye on a summer in Kanazawa, Japan. Also, RIT has a huge deaf/hard of hearing population. I didn't know this before I came to RIT, but I wouldn't want to have missed out on it! I'm not exactly involved with the deaf community, but I have friends who are, and it's a great time. I used to think it was weird seeing people sign to each other everywhere I looked, but now whenever I'm at home I notice the absence. So if you're deaf, hard of hearing, or otherwise, you'll enjoy yourself no matter what!"", ""Get involved. Stay involved. Have fun. There are so many things you can do with your time on campus, the least of which is a club. That doesn't mean you can slack on your school work, so its important to prioritize, but I see no reason for anyone to be miserable while at school. Guys, be warned. There is a (last I checked) 65%/35% ratio of males to females so if you're looking for a party school, might want to look elsewhere. Ladies, there's a saying on the RIT campus that you should be aware of: The odds are good, but the goods are odd. I love it when there are Ninjas and Pirates walking up and down the Quarter Mile. And the last thing: if you find good housing, KEEP IT. Last year I had a friend living off campus in a house that that we lovingly called Hippie Hovel for various reasons. It may not be the cheapest, but trust me; searching for housing in the middle of the summer is not a pleasant experience."", ""Not going to lie on this one, this place is expensive. All those student run activities don't come cheap. Tuition runs me up about 40,000 a year. Depending on campus housing (or not), meal plans, and class fees (mostly for art classes, but there are others), you could conceivably pay more. However, the Financial Aid office and Student Financial Services are able and willing to work with you on your money, and won't ever short change you if there's no reason. There are plenty of scholarships that RIT offers, and of course outside scholarships as well. Being an out of state student, I probably pay a little more than normal, but even for an in state resident, I can't imagine it would be that much cheaper. However, it's not as if the money goes to waste, and RIT clearly knows what they're doing. A new on campus housing facility was just opened this past year, and even if a little expensive, is still very nice. Campus housing is also very clean and organized, and not run down like some places. Academic wise, in my department alone the clean room lab is worth 64 million dollars, but students use it every day. RIT may be a little expensive, but the overall upgraded quality of your education I think makes up for it."", ""I love being at RIT! One of my favorite places. Seriously! I find myself sitting around the house not going to class or doing homework with friends wishing I was back at school. You would think most people who say stuff like that are just weird, but there's just SO much stuff to do that you hardly can be bored, unless you seriously work at it. On the RIT campus alone, there are (rough guess) over a hundred clubs to join, and of course the assorted academic associations and organizations. There's a HUGE Greek presence at this school (5+ fraternities and sororities each), and that makes for some fun night life. The Student Activities board does events two to three times a month, usually a movie or a trip to some local attraction. And speaking of local attractions, RIT is only about 20 minutes from the city! Huge sports arena, museums, parks, great dining, you name it, and it's there. I recommend Dinosaur BBQ. They were featured on the Travel Channel as one of USA's top barbecues! Back to campus, even if you are somehow not involved, there are plenty of places to just hang out with friends. Many of the on campus dorms have outdoor common areas, and on a nice day there are at least two CanJam games going on at all times. Even the academic side is known for its slack-liners in the Infinity Quad! Basically, you need to make an extreme effort not enjoy yourself here."", ""As a third year Microelectronic Engineering student at RIT, there are some pros and cons. RIT is unique in many ways, but also just the same as every other school. To start off with, MicroE is a highly specialized area of electronics study, and as far as I know, only one of two schools in the country that offer this program at an undergraduate level (the other being CalTech). MicroE kids use the clean room lab, learning how to use million dollar equipment that most people wouldn't see having worked in the same field in industry for years. The classes surrounding MicroE are interesting yet challenging. If you're doing well, you either really enjoy the stuff you're learning and know what you're doing, or have a bad professor. RIT professors are just like any other schools', in that some are good and some are bad. If you take the right professors and study hard, you might not get the best grades but you can be sure you'll know what you're doing. Class structure is usually no more than 30 to 35 kids per classroom, but there are still lecture classes with 100+ students. I wouldn't say that every teacher gets up close and personal with the students, but if you make the effort they will help you, usually. In general, the lower level classes are structured as if you've never seen the material before, going up to you'd-best-know-what-you're-doing-by-now classes. I have found that this allows for students to get a firm understanding of the material, and I still remember things that I took in my freshmen Microeconomics class!""]]",Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Rochester-Institute-of-Technology/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/18458,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,13,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00138-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,903596211,903448141,HORIZONTAL,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 36 out of 36 people found this review useful. 1 of 154 Geoff from Avon, NY Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning.

In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population.

Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy.

My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though.

Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours.

The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here.

Oh this school is also extremely diverse, so if you're looking for an experience go here :) Tips for prospective students Make sure you a prepared to work as this school is not for the faint of heart. If you're in an engineering program it's going to be tough, but completely worth it and you should get a job coming right out of college. Bang for the buck For me it's worth it. I'm paying roughly $40,000 a year, but I am given access to a lab that is priced at $64 million, so I can't complain. Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah.

In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

A couple of times they even had a little outdoor pool there."", ""Five stars because of the sheer amount of clubs there are on campus.

I'm sure strange things happen there. I've never been and don't plan on it, but hearing the legend is definitely fun. At the beginning of the school year there was also this big cart driving around campus in the evening. It was towing a trailer that held students and speakers that were blasting music, and there were flashing lights and fog machines attached to it. The driver was speaking about whatever he was advertising through a megaphone. I never could remember what it was for (a club of some sort I'm sure), but it was always funny to see the thing driving around."", ""It IS an expensive school, but most schools are expensive nowadays. It's not like I came out of my first year in disbelief of how perfect the education was or anything, but what makes it 5 stars is how well recognized RIT is as a great school, especially for certain specific degree programs. A degree from RIT is definitely valuable."", ""There's events and clubs very regularly on campus. You can watch the sports teams play too. I enjoyed going to the CAB movie nights - they show a movie on a huge projection screen in one of the auditoriums every Thursday night. It's a lot of fun to go get some food on campus, then see a move with friends."", ""The food is great. I didn't take full advantage of the food on campus until closer to the end of the school year, but I won't make that mistake for the years to come. The meal plan is definitely worth it. Also, get the 10 plus meal plan! You get more food debit that way that you can spend however you want. It's a lot more flexible."", ""The dorms were fun. I loved my roommates, and there was a sense of fun community on the floor. Some dorms/floors have different (better) amenities than others - bigger kitchens/lounges or nicer bathrooms, and some buildings don't have A/C.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer.

But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

Am enjoying being here A good portion of your tuition goes toward an activities fund which means there is never a dull weekend at RIT. Whether it is barbecuing, concerts, movies on the Greek Lawn or other get-togethers, there is always something going on. You just need the initiative to get out of the dorm! If RIT's activities aren't for you there are also hundreds of clubs you can join that will fit your interests. You can even start your own club! Am learning a lot Part of being a Software Engineering major means spending a year with Computer Science students learning the basics of computer programming. When I first came to RIT, I knew nothing about writing code but the classes challenged and taught me well and now I feel that I am fully prepared to begin my major.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it.

Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms.

The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here.

RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

You'll be able to get your math, liberal arts and sciences out of the way early so that you can get to the good stuff and excel in your major!

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus.

But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours.

There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common.

Students also submit filler pieces in between the projects just for fun, to see what we do in our spare time (because we like to pretend we have that).

It's the most widely-known dining hall on campus, buffet-style, but it can get tiring after having to eat there at least 5 times per week. There's a wide variety of food there, and there is usually fresh salad fixings an fresh fruit (my favorite!), and it is all-you-can-eat, which makes eating there worth it (if you eat a lot). Other than that, we have Ritz Sport Zone, Brick City Cafe, The Dining Commons, Crossroads, Salsaritas which all have a variety of foods including pizza, sandwiches, fruits and salads, and different kinds of quesadillas and other ethnic foods at Salaritas. Nathan's soups and sandwiches are AMAZING, Java Wally's coffee shop right outside of the library is convenient as well as Artesanon's Bakery/Cafe and Beans (also a coffee/drink stand), and even the local convenient store-like setup of Sol's Underground serves sandwiches, pizzas, quesadillas, Paninis, milkshakes and icecream. There really is a great number of places to eat at, which is nice when you don't want to eat the same place everyday. In case you don't want readily-made food and want microwavable items, also available are the Corner Store and Marketplace, which are more like grocery stores."", ""Dorm life is pretty great, aside from not having a bathtub or shower.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics.

The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

The teachers in general are great and because this is a hands on and co-op school it makes the learning process a lot easier.

However, students who want to succeed here also need to be dedicated workers and dedicated to doing well.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

I'm paying roughly $40,000 a year, but I am given access to a lab that is priced at $64 million, so I can't complain. Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah.

Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer.

Am learning a lot Part of being a Software Engineering major means spending a year with Computer Science students learning the basics of computer programming. When I first came to RIT, I knew nothing about writing code but the classes challenged and taught me well and now I feel that I am fully prepared to begin my major.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy.

You can have the best intentions and procrastinate and then go out with your friends more and more frequently but then before you",True,0,0,,,"{495886=Due to RIT's fast-paced quarter system, I have rated the academic rigor highly. In the Fall of 2013, the school will be making a switch to semesters. Classes with still be challenging and useful, just longer., 501774=There are alot of demands for other classes that is needed to graduate with a degree such as taking Liberal Arts. Including that with the courses with majors, the work is stressful depending on the courses or the amount is taken. With the Conversion Term to now Semesters. In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

I'm paying roughly $40,000 a year, but I am given access to a lab that is priced at $64 million, so I can't complain. Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah. It's in the middle of Rochester, NY where it is basically gray all the time. Other than that there is plenty of stuff to do and I find myself busy 110% of the time. Am learning a lot My current major is Microelectronic Engineering. RIT is the only school in the nation that offers this major. This school is fantastic and has actually challenged me. I was used to getting an A in everything but in this school that's not possible for me. The teachers in general are great and because this is a hands on and co-op school it makes the learning process a lot easier.

In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

Including that with the courses with majors, the work is stressful depending on the courses or the amount is taken. With the Conversion Term to now Semesters. In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier.

Overall it was not nearly as hard as I had imagined at first.', 'Do not fall behind in your work; the quarter system will be unforgiving if you fall behind. Also, make sure to show up to class and to take good notes. Form study groups with people in your classes for better studying and also some venting, the venting will help to calm you down slightly. Finally, form good relationships with your professors, as there are many opportunities for research at RIT and being in good standing with professors will increase them. Most importantly, sometimes situations may arise that are uncomfortable for students. Leave the situation and contact the appropriate people if necessary. Whatever the problem is, it is not worth sticking around for you to be busted too.', 'The education that one receives at the school is fantastic.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here.

Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common.

The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community.

Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

Am learning a lot My current major is Microelectronic Engineering. RIT is the only school in the nation that offers this major. This school is fantastic and has actually challenged me. I was used to getting an A in everything but in this school that's not possible for me.

In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Am learning a lot My current major is Microelectronic Engineering. RIT is the only school in the nation that offers this major. This school is fantastic and has actually challenged me. I was used to getting an A in everything but in this school that's not possible for me.

In 2012-2013 year, the classes were only 10 weeks long in quarters. Now from 2013 and on, will be 15 weeks long in Semesters instead. More time with assignments, projects and in terms of learning. It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer.

The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments.

One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands.

Whether it is barbecuing, concerts, movies on the Greek Lawn or other get-togethers, there is always something going on. You just need the initiative to get out of the dorm! If RIT's activities aren't for you there are also hundreds of clubs you can join that will fit your interests. You can even start your own club! Am learning a lot Part of being a Software Engineering major means spending a year with Computer Science students learning the basics of computer programming. When I first came to RIT, I knew nothing about writing code but the classes challenged and taught me well and now I feel that I am fully prepared to begin my major. RIT does a good job of preparing you for the classes that matter. You'll be able to get your math, liberal arts and sciences out of the way early so that you can get to the good stuff and excel in your major!

Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

I'm paying roughly $40,000 a year, but I am given access to a lab that is priced at $64 million, so I can't complain. Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah. It's in the middle of Rochester, NY where it is basically gray all the time. Other than that there is plenty of stuff to do and I find myself busy 110% of the time. Am learning a lot My current major is Microelectronic Engineering. RIT is the only school in the nation that offers this major. This school is fantastic and has actually challenged me. I was used to getting an A in everything but in this school that's not possible for me.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community!

Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

I'm paying roughly $40,000 a year, but I am given access to a lab that is priced at $64 million, so I can't complain. Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus.

The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys.

Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013.

One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

They set things up where you have plenty of time everyday to eat, hang out, get a job, or join a club. The only thing that I find disappointing is that they have a limit on how many credits you are allowed to earn per semester. If you are interested in actually coming to school to learn like you're supposed to, then you might want to try to get into the honors program here so that your limit on allowed credits is raised."", ""You will NOT have a problem getting used to it here.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Whether it is barbecuing, concerts, movies on the Greek Lawn or other get-togethers, there is always something going on. You just need the initiative to get out of the dorm! If RIT's activities aren't for you there are also hundreds of clubs you can join that will fit your interests. You can even start your own club! Am learning a lot Part of being a Software Engineering major means spending a year with Computer Science students learning the basics of computer programming. When I first came to RIT, I knew nothing about writing code but the classes challenged and taught me well and now I feel that I am fully prepared to begin my major. RIT does a good job of preparing you for the classes that matter. You'll be able to get your math, liberal arts and sciences out of the way early so that you can get to the good stuff and excel in your major!

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy.

Moving off campus early, cutting out your meal-plan, applying for scholarships, increasing your financial aid, and getting good grades are only some of the decisions that you have to make. This school is so worth the money seeing all of the opportunities it presents to you. Co-op's are and essential part of this!"", 'Join clubs, there are more than you could even think of. Try intramural sports are a great way to meet people, relieve stress and get in a workout. You can go to the gym and get your pump on! Wellness classes are another way to meet people and learn new skills. They are like gym classes, but they offer specific classes like kickboxing or fencing, even hiking and fishing. Anything you want to do, you name it!', 'Food is amazing, and there are so many varieties on campus. Dining hall food, to pizza and wings, to mexican food, you name it!', 'Dorm life can be exciting depending on where you live. Some of the dorms are all male or female which limits your ability to meet people. Also, being stuck in Ellingston dorms means you are populated by a majority of deaf students, which is by no means a bad thing, but yet again limits your ability to meet people.', 'You have chances to learn and understand the working world before you ever go out on co-op. Your professors and mentors will guide you through their past experiences and how it will better your career!', 'Get affiliated with your college and get to know your professors. Join clubs or organizations and get your name out there!', 'The most experienced professors you will ever have. Great working environments and labs are top notch.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments.

One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier.

If you're lucky to have spare meal options, food debit or tiger bucks there are more delicious options scattered throughout the campus, pointedly Brick City and Global Village. Also the crepes in Freshens are really decent, probably gained at least five pounds there alone. Also the cafes around campus are really decent from greatest to least: Java Wally's (only credit/debit or tiger bucks though), Midnight Oil, Artesano's, and Beans. Nathan's Soups is also a place that quickly wipes out debit because it's got some nice soups and chili's year round. The campus is also very food conscious about being vegetarian, vegan, gluten free friendly. A++ on that.

While some professors are more lenient than others, the semester goes by faster than you think.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for.

Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics.

The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here.

RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Other on-campus places to eat are Salsaritas (a Mexican place with delicious quesadillas), Crossroads markets (a better version of Gracie's), Commons (a bit more expensive but great pizza), RITZ Sports Zone, Brick City Cafe (great for breakfast), a couple other places.

If you do have a meal plan with more meals and less debit, you can use your left over meal options at the end of the weak to buy food from on-campus stores. I ran into both of these problems my first semester: I was on the 14+ meal plan and ran out of food debit in the first couple months, and I got stuck with a terrible teacher for my Multivariable Calculus class and had to teach myself the material for most of the tests.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here.

Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends.

But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J.

It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

With the required co-op education I have already had a job in my field and started networking with professionals in my work force. Also the small class sizes has allowed me to be more than just a number in a class to a professor.

There's also racket ball courts, the Red Barn has rock climbing, and for runners the loop around campus is a common route. Also, the College Activities Board (CAB) is always planning something, like Brick City Weekend, which is out homecoming weekend including many events with the biggest one being a hockey game in downtown Rochester. Freeze Fest is in the winter followed by Spring Fest, both give out free gear around campus just look for a nice long line."", ""Like any college food it take a little time to get used to it, but over all the main dinning room at RIT, Gracie's, has decent food, but there are better places to go. RIT Brick City Cafe has great, fresh, breakfast and lunch. RIT Sportz Zone which is like a sports bar, Crossroads is another dinning facility on the opposite end of campus from the dorms, Salsaritas is a favorite, and RIT opened a new crepes place which has nutella crepes, a personal favorite!"", ""Your dorm has enough people on the floor that you're bound to find a group of people you like to hang out with. You can't have a microwave in your room which stinks, but there is one in the common room on your floor. While your room isn't the biggest, it does provide just enough space for your stuff. What is really cool about the dorms is the tunnel system, you don't have to go outside in the snow to go to the dinning hall or to do laundry. There's also a grocery store in the tunnel, along with a fast food place called Sol's and a Richie's game room."", ""What I've found that your core major classes, while they may be hard, are enjoyable but do require work. Classes in general are rigorous but if you stay ahead of the game, by studying gradually and not cramming you should be fine. Ratemyprofessor.com is key when picking out your classes, a great professor makes all the difference in any class."", ""Don't be afraid or too proud to ask for help. RIT offers help in almost all of their classes and if there isn't a Teacher Assistance for your class or you want a tutor for one-on-one help, the Academic Support Center is more than willing to find you a tutor."", 'While the courses are challenging, the professors are there for their students every step of the way.

Plus it is the only school for my major that allows you to use their cleanroom as an undergraduate student. Am enjoying being here The school itself is fantastic; however, the location is a bit blah.

The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys.

The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013.

One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands.

I started my first year in 4 different clubs including 2 martial arts, a sign language learning club, and a club for debating sports.

Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

It is much better., 247378=RIT is switching to semesters in Fall 2013 so don't worry about the quarter system. Don't fall behind on your work. Don't eat at Gracies too much. Get as much financial aid as you can. Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier.

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

If RIT's activities aren't for you there are also hundreds of clubs you can join that will fit your interests. You can even start your own club! Am learning a lot Part of being a Software Engineering major means spending a year with Computer Science students learning the basics of computer programming. When I first came to RIT, I knew nothing about writing code but the classes challenged and taught me well and now I feel that I am fully prepared to begin my major. RIT does a good job of preparing you for the classes that matter. You'll be able to get your math, liberal arts and sciences out of the way early so that you can get to the good stuff and excel in your major!

So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning.

Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with.

Be prepared to be terrified when you are preparing to transition to a sophomore and have to find a new housing situation., 15136=I stated school at RIT in September, 2008. So far it has been one of the most unexpected learning experiences of my life and I couldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt be more grateful for the lessons that I am learning. I did very well in high school academically but what make the experience here at RIT are the lessons you learn both inside and out of the classrooms. For example, one of the greatest experiences I think I√¢¬Ä¬ôve had so far is to have the opportunity to learn from a whole new community, the Deaf community! In case you didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt know RIT is a very well known school for its NTID program and exceptionally large portion of deaf students included in its student body population. This is something I didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt really look into or know before I got here, but it has been a very interesting experience to live around and become friends with students who are from a whole other way of life. Another example though for inside the classroom, I believe it has been to my benefit this last year to have been a part of a learning community. My learning community was basically my floor and the floor above me in my dorm building, and the catch with these is that for the most part they are the people you are friends with on your first day, they√¢¬Ä¬ôre the first ones you run into when you√¢¬Ä¬ôre moving all your stuff in and they√¢¬Ä¬ôre also the classmates and friends that you go to all your same classes with. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt think without having a learning community to study with and brainstorm with outside of the classroom that I would have done as well as I did last year, and I would really highly recommend you try and talk to your academic advisor to have you placed in one., 554029=Get to know what CAB (College Activities Board) will offer. They host events ALL THE TIME. Also, just go around the Campus Center and ask the offices what they do. There's really always something to do on campus. It's most alive during Brick City Weekend in October, Freezefest in February, and Springfest in April. Also, try going downtown to the South Wedge and seeing what there is to do. The Lilac festival goes on in May if you're still around. Rochester may be scary, but it's also very interesting and gives a lot of students things to do, especially when you're older., 709833=There are a ton of clubs dedicated to niche interest and being nerdy. I personally love Electronic Gaming Society. As far as off campus, there's a downtown scene but I haven't personally explored it. RIT also hosts some pretty cool events such as Imagine RIT, and Brick City. There's a new division 1 hockey rink opening in Fall 2014, which I'm personally dying for. The College Activities Board is also dead-set on hosting activities that get students to socialize and have fun., 540285=Singing Piano Man at 9:00 on Saturdays depending on where and who you are with., 425151=Some classes were more rigorous than others and some teachers expected more than others- so it depends. Overall I feel like I learned a lot and a lot of expected of me, especially in organic chemistry and the physics program is a lot of material for a quarter system, though in 2013 RIT is changing to semesters., 107823=RIT currently runs on the Quarter system. But if you are planning to go here, be prepared for the semester conversion in 2013., 349674=I love RIT! it is a fast pace class schedule, which is changing in 2013/14., 95200=RIT is so safe thanks to the Campus Safety's quick response and excellence, I actually feel safer here since almost no crime occurs here. Consider this excerpt from Wiki; In 2006 Rochester had 1259.6 reported violent crimes per 100,000 residents, compared to a national rate of 553.5.[32] For 2006, Rochester had 827 personal crime incidents per 100,000 and 7,173 property crime incidents per 100,000., 54523=Considering my major only? Yea, kind of. As a hearing person, I do tend to feel outted sometimes because of that by a few students - but, that's only because I'm in the interpreting program and am way conscious/sensitive about the Deaf community. My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

My friends in other majors LOVE it here. Considering my experiences excluding my major? I LOVE it here. I've made friends in practically every major. I don't like the night scene, so I can't say much about it. I know it happens if you like that sorta thing, though. The only thing I don't really like is that, as a girl, I'm consistently being looked at by guys. The ratio is 7:1 (or something like that) here at RIT, so it was pretty shocking when I first arrived here. Other than that, I enjoy being here. The quarters suck, but the people are generally nice, and once you make friends it's for life (but if you found someone you don't like the campus is large enough to never have to see them again)., 233786=There are outside events year round, even in the winter, and the October Brick City Homecoming is an excellent time for your family to visit, and to have the opportunity to see guest speakers - such as Al Pacino and Michael J. Fox., 761796=√Ç¬© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 118860=Learn to use the tunnels and find out which buildings connect. You will be grateful for it in winter. Bring enough warm clothes. It is cold a lot of the time and spring doesn't really start here until halfway through April. When they say It's Always Cloudy in Rochester they mean it. Avoid 8 AM classes your first year (or at all in my opinion). It is not fun to walk from from dorm side to academic side early in the morning when you aren't a morning person. Get an all-debit meal plan as soon as you hit second year status. Everything is better than Gracie's., 563296=There is a gym open until 10:30 every night as well as a smaller gym open 24 hours. There are parties there if that is your thing. There is an insane amount of clubs and organizations from ones with a political agenda to others that are social and meant to help people relax and meet people with some stuff in common. There are loads of speakers that come in with interesting topics. Greek life is active on campus, and there always seems to be some event going on from puppyfest to mud-tug RIT knows how to have fun and help charities and animal shelters in the process., 288517=As far as the students and the environment, RIT is a great place to be. The weather this year (2011-12) wasn't so bad, but I heard there is snow most of the time here. Sometimes, the teachers who are the best at what they teach (especially for math and physics) can be the most frustrating and don't communicate well with students., 138309=I came to RIT in 2010 as a Honors student pursuing a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. RIT's quarter system is a mixed blessing: vacations are staggered to not interrupt the flow of learning, you get variety in your classes each quarter, and there is time each year to take a bunch of classes. Unfortunately, time constraints make it easy to fall behind, and the emphasis is on facility and application rather than comprehension. The best part of learning at RIT are the academic communities that spring up- department, teachers, and their students are very close-knit and supportive, and this closeness allows them to easily connect with other departments. This makes cross-discipline opportunities plentiful, and emphasizes the gain from how easy it is to get your out-of-major classes done early., 264174=Right now RIT is on the quarter system but they're transitioning to semester in fall 2013. So right now the 10-week quarter is fast and I think it helps because it's fast and so is the pace of a real job., 41149=I started at RIT in September of 2008 as an Accounting major. One of the most appealing things about RIT is the co-op program. I am able to take two trimesters off of school without falling behind to intern in my field of study. I am learning so much and can apply everything I learned in the classroom setting to the work I do. The teachers are helpful and understanding, but strict. They oftentimes don't take attendance because they put the responsibility of going to class in your hands. Once you realize going to class is the only effective way to learn, things start becoming a lot easier. I have learned so much and have been able to take classes in many different colleges within RIT.}"

Maintaining safe and efficient facilities becomes increasingly expensive as the Eccles Building, built in 1933, and the Martin Building, completed in 1974, get older. Major infrastructure enhancements are in progress to maintain a safe and productive environment. Emergency planning, including work to provide backup electrical power, will continue. Actions to evaluate and, where necessary, enhance the security of facilities to provide for the safety of employees and continuity of operations are a priority., 16204=While many aspects of the Board√Ø¬ø¬Ωs mission are unique to the organization, the Board does not operate in a vacuum. To coordinate its activities, the staff works closely with a broad variety of organizations and individuals on a daily basis. Regular meetings with senior officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other executive branch agencies help ensure consistency of purpose and coordination of actions. One area of the Board√Ø¬ø¬Ωs mission, supervision and regulation of financial institutions, is shared with other regulatory agencies. As required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and in conformance with past practice, the Board has worked closely with the other federal agencies to consider plans and strategies for programs such as bank supervision that transcend the jurisdiction of each agency. Coordination of activities with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other agencies is evident throughout both the strategic and performance plans. Given the degree of similarity in missions and the existence of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), the most formal effort has occurred with the other depository institution regulatory agencies (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision). The FFIEC promotes uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions by the five federal regulatory agencies. The FFIEC was established in 1979 pursuant to title X of the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978. It is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. In addition, the council provides uniform examiner training and has taken a lead in developing standardized software needed for major data collection programs to support the requirements of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). These actions have eliminated redundancy and lowered costs and, in the case of the HMDA and the CRA, have significantly lowered compliance costs while enhancing public access to the data., 7321=As required by the GPRA, this plan is independent of other related plans. However, numerous documents, when used in conjunction with this plan, give a more detailed picture of the planning, budget, operations, and performance of the System. As required by the Federal Reserve Act, the Board submits to the Congress an annual report that describes in detail the operations of the System for the previous year. Since 1985 the System has also provided the Congress with a supplement, the Annual Report: Budget Review. This document provides a detailed explanation of the plans and resources contained in the approved budgets of the Board and the Reserve Banks. The most recent versions of these two documents were provided to the Congress in April 2004., 108093=Resources: For the 2004-05 biennium, approximately $228.0 million in costs for 887 positions, facilities, and other costs.

Forward final Check 21 regulations to the Board by summer 2004., 91066=Planning and budgeting are essential to the effective operations of the Board, particularly because of the complexity of its operations and its obligation to the public in the use and management of non-appropriated funds. Administrative and operational areas must engage in strategic and long-term planning to identify future challenges and to have trained and equipped staff in place to address these challenges. In addition to internally focusing on planning, the Board, with the Reserve Banks, developed the Strategic Framework, published in late 1996, to coordinate the strategic planning of all entities within the System. This document was the basis for the Strategic Planning Document submitted to the Congress in response to the Government Performance and Results Act., 18606=In connection with the GPRA, a coordinating committee of the depository institution regulatory agencies was created to address and report on issues of mutual concern. The interagency working group has been meeting since June 1997 to work on issues related to those general goals and objectives that cross agency functions, programs, and activities. The results of the interagency coordination, whether effected through the FFIEC, the coordinating group, or interaction between staff, have been positive and have yielded better plans, creating substantial benefits to the public., 104689=Resources: For the 2004-05 biennium, approximately $97.3 million in costs for 197 positions and allocated costs for support, facilities, and overhead.

Include payments-related questions in the 2004 Michigan Survey; produce research results in 2005., 90470=A safe workplace that enhances productivity is a valuable asset to the Board. Maintaining safe and efficient facilities becomes increasingly expensive as the Eccles Building, built in 1933, and the Martin Building, completed in 1974, get older. Major infrastructure enhancements are in progress to maintain a safe and productive environment. Emergency planning, including work to provide backup electrical power, will continue. Actions to evaluate and, where necessary, enhance the security of facilities to provide for the safety of employees and continuity of operations are a priority., 16204=While many aspects of the Board√Ø¬ø¬Ωs mission are unique to the organization, the Board does not operate in a vacuum. To coordinate its activities, the staff works closely with a broad variety of organizations and individuals on a daily basis. Regular meetings with senior officials from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, regulatory agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other executive branch agencies help ensure consistency of purpose and coordination of actions. One area of the Board√Ø¬ø¬Ωs mission, supervision and regulation of financial institutions, is shared with other regulatory agencies. As required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and in conformance with past practice, the Board has worked closely with the other federal agencies to consider plans and strategies for programs such as bank supervision that transcend the jurisdiction of each agency. Coordination of activities with the U.S. Department of the Treasury and other agencies is evident throughout both the strategic and performance plans. Given the degree of similarity in missions and the existence of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), the most formal effort has occurred with the other depository institution regulatory agencies (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision). The FFIEC promotes uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions by the five federal regulatory agencies. The FFIEC was established in 1979 pursuant to title X of the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978. It is a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions and to make recommendations to promote uniformity in the supervision of financial institutions. In addition, the council provides uniform examiner training and has taken a lead in developing standardized software needed for major data collection programs to support the requirements of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). These actions have eliminated redundancy and lowered costs and, in the case of the HMDA and the CRA, have significantly lowered compliance costs while enhancing public access to the data., 7321=As required by the GPRA, this plan is independent of other related plans. However, numerous documents, when used in conjunction with this plan, give a more detailed picture of the planning, budget, operations, and performance of the System. As required by the Federal Reserve Act, the Board submits to the Congress an annual report that describes in detail the operations of the System for the previous year. Since 1985 the System has also provided the Congress with a supplement, the Annual Report: Budget Review. This document provides a detailed explanation of the plans and resources contained in the approved budgets of the Board and the Reserve Banks. The most recent versions of these two documents were provided to the Congress in April 2004., 108093=Resources: For the 2004-05 biennium, approximately $228.0 million in costs for 887 positions, facilities, and other costs.
