College is much different the professors don't really care if you do/do not show up to class or if you do your homework this is all about adult life and you need to learn to stay on top of your stuff.Same goes with homework in college there is little homework which sounds awesome but in reality thats not a good thing the less homework you have the more impact that is made by your test scores and final so make sure you know and understand everything that is being discussed in class."", ""CSUN has an absolutely beautiful campus at first it may seem a bit intimidating but once you get used to it you'll grow to love it.

Also they are fairly overpriced, but I do still wish I dormed to meet new people., 235458=there are many fun events held at c.su.n. such as concerts by well known artists like b.o.b. and the cataracs, who performed in the fall semester, 2011. they recently built the student recreational center where students can become fit and active. best part it is free for students! during the hot weathers c.s.u.n. has a big pool where students can cool off., 75282=Great school. May not have the prestige of other schools like the UCs but it is one of the best CSUs in the state and has a great business program., 874348=I had no fun time. I tranferred in 2006 Fall semester from Mission College and I Graduated from CSUN in Spring 2008. My goal was to complete my BA as soon as possible because I was having a baby in Sep 2008. I had no time to see or do fun things at school... but study,go to class and take exams., 740882=I've been a student majoring in Civil Engineering here at Cal State Northridge since the Fall of 2007. I have seen the campus grow with student life and expand. CSUN has just finished building a new student recreation center, parking structures, updated technology in classrooms, and improved student life on campus. Overall I have enjoyed my years here and despite the large majority of peers commuting to and from, the student body can connect on campus. Go Matadors!, 714536=CSUN has an entire escort system that guards the library and personally approaches students to walk them either to their car or back to the dorms. Security guards have two shacks on the outskirts of Student Housing and patrol from 7:30 pm- 3:00 am. The guards are pretty cool, they actually like chatting with students and asking what's going on with them. They also patrol inside of Student Housing too., 597215=They are not acceptng new applicants until 2013., 739714=CSUN has updated their dormitory life since 2007 and provided better meals for on campus dining., 122576=This year 2012 the hired various security! Its really good., 987137=It`s no wonder than CSUN is ranked 68th in the 2013 edition of Best Colleges is Regional Universities (West) by US News. This school offers incredibly small class sizes which are ideal for getting the best of lecture time. CSUN`s vast variety of degree programs ensures than just about anyone can attend CSUN and study what he or she wishes.}","07/21/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 43 out of 44 people found this review useful. 1 of 295 Kirk from Northridge, CA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

First, get out of your comfort Zone. The first year makes this the easiest, just be more outgoing. No one really knows anyone else so make friends, join clubs and you will have a blast. Second, plan your time. You will have so many things to do that it's hard to keep it all organized. Find a system that works, and make sure you add some time by yourself to relax. College gets stressful but what gets you through it is friends to laugh with and the thought that all this is to prepare for your future career. It's all worth it. Third, go to class. There are times when you will just be too tired or maybe sick or just too stressed to go to a class. So go to class everyday because you never know when you will get sick and have to miss it. Keep in mind that even just a one hour class can have so much information packed into it that you will have to take much longer to catch up."", ""I'm not going to put 5 stars for this since college isn't free. However, Stout does put our money to good use. We pay about the same as what other colleges charge, but there are a few perks that we get and other colleges don't offer. For instance, we get a laptop, it works as well as it needs to and there are people to go to if we have computer troubles and need help. We also get to rent our books. No worrying over buying expensive books that we will only use for one semester and then they will college dust on our desks. Here at Stout we rent our books for a semester and then return them when we are done."", ""I made so many new friends my first year and we all helped each other cope with the changes. My First Year Adviser was a very big help and made me learn to ask questions and figure out who i should ask the questions to. All my professors were a big help too. They were all nice and understanding of the changes we were going through but they didn't make classes any easier, they gave us enough challenges so that we could stay focused on school work and figure out how to plan our time around studying and social time. They also made class fun so we would feel like we missed out if we missed class. The campus is beautiful too, and even thought the town is smaller, there are still a lot of things that go on around campus and in town."", 'Just in my first year here at Stout, I have learned countless amounts of information spanning from who I am to what I learn in classes. Stout is a very technological school, when I first came to stout all I knew about computers was how to use Microsoft Word and play Solitaire. After just one year, studying Psychology, I have learned so much more about computers since we all get one from the school and use it almost everyday. The Internet brings the us all together since we can communicate with our professors and classmates and even new friends to get help on homework or plan social events. My Professors were all really great too. They went beyond the book to help me understand certain concepts and apply what we learned in one class to a discussion we were having in another. Stout is very environmentally friendly also. I was able to learn a lot about what will help or hinder out environment and how much what one person does can affect the whole world. Because of interactions with all the people there, I was able to learn more about myself.

Now as far as bang for your buck, I think its pretty worth it to pay what we do for credits, the teachers are very helpful and they know that your paying to take their class so they do their best to make it worth your while. Meal plans can get very expensive fast, so be careful what you choose. You do get a microwave and a refrigerator in your dorm room so you can have food in there if you choose not to eat at the commons. Speaking of the commons, this is where you would eat most if not all of your meals, this food is the least expensive on campus and its mostly worth what you pay for. Some of it tastes good and some of it doesn't, just depending on what you like personally, so be careful when choosing your meal plan. Overall Stout is worth the bang for the buck."", ""I can't give this category all five stars because I am not exactly pleased with the way that Stout handles extra-curricular activities. During the first few weeks it was fun because everyone kind of had their days planned out and there was so much do to! And now since the semester has been rolling on, the activities for the majority of students has been leveled out and all that is left to do is go out and party. Which I choose not to do so I do not enjoy it as much as I would like to. I have started to attend things such as Campus Crusade every Thursday and I enjoy myself there. They have shown me that you don't have to go out all the time to have a good time. They have provided many things to do without going to a house party. There are many things for students to do during the course of the week, which I choose to do some of them if I'm not doing homework, but on the weekends not much is provided. This is why I have only given this category three stars."", 'This school has very knowledgeable and helpful professors. It has been a huge help to me in order to understand the material for the classes. By actually asking the professor questions you have can make a world of difference. I have learned a lot here and I have only been attending for one semester. The class sizes are small and intimate. Although the lectures may seem bigger than most would like, the professor doesnt forget that you are there and they try to interact with you as much as possible as if you were taking the class in a smaller size. I gave this five stars because I believe that the staff here really try to teach you as well as possible, they know the reason why you are taking the course, weather it be just a general or a major specific course they try to help you as much as you need it.

Stout is a very technological school, when I first came to stout all I knew about computers was how to use Microsoft Word and play Solitaire. After just one year, studying Psychology, I have learned so much more about computers since we all get one from the school and use it almost everyday. The Internet brings the us all together since we can communicate with our professors and classmates and even new friends to get help on homework or plan social events. My Professors were all really great too. They went beyond the book to help me understand certain concepts and apply what we learned in one class to a discussion we were having in another. Stout is very environmentally friendly also. I was able to learn a lot about what will help or hinder out environment and how much what one person does can affect the whole world. Because of interactions with all the people there, I was able to learn more about myself. I was able to take the new-found freedom i had and use it to pursue passions that i never knew i had until I went out on a limb and tried different things. Login to rate or flag the",True,0,0,

Version 1.0 has been working very solidly with the exception of a minor glitch when updating from Drupal 5. The reason for releasing 1.1 was to provide a defined base for starting the migration to Drupal 7. Unfortunately, the fix was not perfect and had the potential to produce a harmless warning message. 1.2 avoids that warning message. Changes since 1.0: Enhancements: - Clean up some minor coder issues (no functional changes). Bugs fixed: - #694236: Suppress a harmless but irritating warning from acl_update_6001(), introduced in the #680324 fix. - #680324: Add missing index if upgraded from D5. Note: The devel_node_access (DNA) module, which is part of the Devel module, provides an in-depth view into the inner workings of node access, especially if you enable its debug mode at admin/settings/devel#edit-devel-node-access-debug-mode and its second block. This is a big help for understanding the forces that control access to any given node. Note the Drupal core issues listed on the ACL front page, which are outside the scope of ACL. Help resolve these issues to make ACL perform even better! View change notices for this release Official release from tag:√Ç¬† 6.x-1.2",False,-1,0,"Tue, 28 Jul 2015 02:51:09 GMT"

Report a person whose income comes from the rent of lands or buildings as ""landlord."" Report a person who receives his income, or most of it, from money loaned at interest, or from stocks, bonds, or other securities, as a ""capitalist."" 162. Report a student who supports himself by some occupation according to the occupation, if more time is given to that, but as a student, if more time is given to study. Thus report a student who does stenographic work as a student unless more of his time is spent in stenography. Report a salesman in a grocery store, who attends a night school as ""salesman, groceries,"" because most of his day is spent in the store. 161. In farming sections, where a farm is found that is under the management or supervision of a woman as owner or tenant, return the occupation of such woman as ""farmer"" in all cases. 160. If a married woman has a gainful occupation, return the occupation accordingly, whether she does the work at her home or goes regularly to a place of employment, and whether she is regularly or only occasionally so employed.","Unemployment back to top 177.
