This chapter is used primarily as a summary for decision-makers who only want to work through the next chapter as an overview. A4.1 Main benefits of WAFs The main benefit of a WAF is the subsequent protection of completed, productive web applications on the application level with a reasonable amount of effort and without having to change the application itself. On the one hand, the WAF offers a basic protection against known attacks or vulnerabilities based on blacklists: The data security standard of the credit card industry (PCI DSS v.1.1) for example, in its current version prescribes the use of a WAF - as an alternative to regular code reviews by a specialist - as an adequate measure to protect web applications. The WAF is therefore a suitable tool for attaining industrial standards as well as fulfilling legal requirements. The use of a WAF becomes especially relevant in the case of concrete vulnerabilities, for example uncovered via penetration tests or source code reviews. Even if it were possible to fix the vulnerability in the application promptly and with a reasonable amount of effort, the modified version can generally only be deployed at the next maintenance interval,",True,0,0,"{18744=Version 1.0.5, March 2008, English wiki 10.

Report a person whose income comes from the rent of lands or buildings as ""landlord."" Report a person who receives his income, or most of it, from money loaned at interest, or from stocks, bonds, or other securities, as a ""capitalist."" 162.

Thus report a student who does stenographic work as a student unless more of his time is spent in stenography. Report a salesman in a grocery store, who attends a night school as ""salesman, groceries,"" because most of his day is spent in the store. 161. In farming sections, where a farm is found that is under the management or supervision of a woman as owner or tenant, return the occupation of such woman as ""farmer"" in all cases. 160.
