on average, a decade earlier than the cohorts that Steenland and Sanderson (2001) examined. The McDonald cohort, drawn from eight plants, had more years of exposure in the industry (19 versus 8.8 years). The Steenland and Sanderson (2001) cohort worked in 16 plants, 7 of which overlapped with the McDonald, et al. (2001) cohort. McDonald et al. (2001), Hughes et al. (2001), and Rando et al. (2001) had access to smoking histories, plant records, and exposure measurements that allowed for historical reconstruction and the development of a job exposure matrix. Steenland and Sanderson (2001) had limited access to plant facilities, less detailed historic exposure data, and used MSHA enforcement records for estimates of recent exposure. These studies (Hughes et al., 2001; McDonald et al., 2005; Steenland and Sanderson, 2001) show very similar exposure response patterns of increased lung cancer mortality with increased exposure. OSHA included the quantitative exposure-response analysis from the Hughes et al. (2001) study in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (Section II)., 575275=Because there is little available information on the incidence of occupational cancer across all industries, risk from crystalline silica exposure cannot be compared with overall risk from other workplace carcinogens. However, OSHA's previous risk assessments provide estimates of risk from exposure to certain carcinogens. These risk assessments, as with the current assessment for crystalline silica, were based on animal or human data of reasonable or high quality and used the best information then available. Table VII-4 shows the Agency's best estimates of cancer risk from 45 years of occupational exposure to several carcinogens, as published in the preambles to final rules promulgated since the benzene decision in 1980. These risks were judged by the Agency to be significant., 241614=As a follow-up to the SEP, OSHA undertook numerous non-regulatory actions to address silica exposures. For example, in October of 1996, OSHA launched a joint silicosis prevention effort with MSHA, NIOSH, and the American Lung Association (DOL, 1996). This public education campaign involved distribution of materials on how to prevent silicosis, including a guide for working safely with silica and stickers for hard hats to remind workers of crystalline silica hazards. Spanish language versions of these materials were also made available. OSHA and MSHA inspectors distributed materials at mines, construction sites, and other affected workplaces. The joint silicosis prevention effort included a National Conference to Eliminate Silicosis in Washington, DC, in March of 1997, which brought together approximately 650 participants from labor, business, government, and the health and safety professions to exchange ideas and share solutions to reach the goal of eliminating silicosis. The conference highlighted the best methods of eliminating silicosis and included problem-solving workshops on how to prevent the disease in specific industries and job operations; plenary sessions with senior government, labor, and corporate officials; and opportunities to meet with safety and health professionals who had implemented successful silicosis prevention programs., 250593=In 1997, OSHA announced in its Unified Agenda under Long-Term Actions that it planned to publish a proposed rule on crystalline silica Ã¢Â€Âœbecause the agency has concluded that there will be no significant progress in the prevention of silica-related diseases without the adoption of a full and comprehensive silica standard, including provisions for product substitution, engineering controls, training and education, respiratory protection and medical screening and surveillance. A full standard will improve worker protection, ensure adequate prevention programs, and further reduce silica-related diseases.Ã¢Â€? (62 FR 57755, 57758, Oct. 29, 1997). In November 1998, OSHA moved Ã¢Â€ÂœOccupational Exposure to Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€? to the pre-rule stage in the Regulatory Plan (63 FR 61284, 61303-304, Nov. 9, 1998). OSHA held a series of stakeholder meetings in 1999 and 2000 to get input on the rulemaking. Stakeholder meetings for all industry sectors were held in Washington, Chicago, and San Francisco. A separate stakeholder meeting for the construction sector was held in Atlanta., 518267=OSHA also evaluated several longitudinal studies where exposed workers were examined over a period of time to track changes in pulmonary function. Among both active and retired Vermont granite workers exposed to an average of 60 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3, Graham did not find exposure-related decrements in pulmonary function (Graham et al., 1981, 1994). However, Eisen et al. (1995) did find significant pulmonary decrements among a subset of granite workers (termed Ã¢Â€ÂœdropoutsÃ¢Â€?) who left work and consequently did not voluntarily participate in the last of a series of annual pulmonary function tests. This group of workers experienced steeper declines in FEV 1 compared to the subset of workers who remained at work and participated in all tests (termed Ã¢Â€ÂœsurvivorsÃ¢Â€?), and these declines were significantly related to dust exposure. Thus, in this study, workers who had left work had exposure-related declines in pulmonary function to a greater extent than did workers who remained on the job, clearly demonstrating a survivor effect among the active workers. Exposure-related changes in lung function were also reported in a 12-year study of granite workers (Malmberg et al., 1993), in two 5-year studies of South African miners (Hnizdo, 1992; Cowie, 1998), and in a study of foundry workers whose lung function was assessed between 1978 and 1992 (Hertzberg et al., 2002)., 571429=Fatal injury rates for most U.S. industries and occupations may be obtained from data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Table VII-3 shows annual fatality rates per 1,000 employees for several industries for 2007, as well as projected fatalities per 1,000 employees assuming exposure to workplace hazards for 45 years based on these annual rates (BLS, 2010). While it is difficult to meaningfully compare aggregate industry fatality rates to the risks estimated in the quantitative risk assessment for crystalline silica, which address one specific hazard (inhalation exposure to respirable crystalline silica) and several health outcomes (lung cancer, silicosis, NMRD, renal disease mortality), these rates provide a useful frame of reference for considering risk from inhalation exposure to crystalline silica. For example, OSHA's estimated range of 6-60 excess lung cancer deaths per 1,000 workers from regular occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica in the range of 0.05Ã¢Â€Â”0.1 mg/m3is roughly comparable to, or higher than, the expected risk of fatal injuries over a working life in high-risk occupations such as mining and construction (see Table VII-3). Regular exposures at higher levels, including the current construction and shipyard PELs for respirable crystalline silica, are expected to cause substantially more deaths per 1,000 workers from lung cancer (ranging from 37 to 653 per 1,000) than result from occupational injuries in most private industry. At the proposed PEL of 0.05 mg/m3respirable crystalline silica, the Agency's estimate of excess lung cancer mortality, from 6 to 26 deaths per 1,000 workers, is still 3- to10-fold or more higher than private industry's average fatal injury rate, given the same employment time, and substantially exceeds those rates found in lower-risk industries such as finance and educational and health services., 243025=In 2003, OSHA examined enforcement data for the years between 1997 and 2002 and identified high rates of noncompliance with the OSHA respirable crystalline silica PEL, particularly in construction. This period covers the first five years of the SEP. These enforcement data, presented in Table 1, indicate that 24 percent of silica samples from the construction industry and 13 percent from general industry were at least three times the OSHA PEL. The data indicate that 66 percent of the silica samples obtained during inspections in general industry were in compliance with the PEL, while only 58 percent of the samples collected in construction were in compliance., 259815=When heated or cooled sufficiently, crystalline silica can transition between the polymorphic forms, with specific transitions occurring at different temperatures. At higher temperatures the linkages between the silica tetrahedrons break and reform, resulting in new crystalline structures. Quartz converts to cristobalite at 1470 Ã‚Â°C, and at 1723 Ã‚Â°C cristobalite loses its crystalline structure and becomes amorphous fused silica. These high temperature transitions reverse themselves at extremely slow rates, with different forms co-existing for a long time after the crystal cools., 368096=Calvert et al. (1997) found an increased incidence of non-systemic ESRD cases among 2,412 South Dakota gold miners exposed to a median crystalline silica concentration of 0.09 mg/m3. In another study of South Dakota gold miners, Steenland and Brown (1995a) reported a positive trend of chronic renal disease mortality risk and cumulative exposure to respirable crystalline silica, but most of the excess deaths were concentrated among workers hired before 1930 when exposures were likely higher than in more recent years., 240885=In August 1996, the Agency initiated enforcement efforts under a Special Emphasis Program (SEP) on crystalline silica. The SEP was intended to reduce worker silica dust exposures that can cause silicosis. It included extensive outreach as well as inspections. Among the outreach materials available were slides presenting information on hazard recognition and crystalline silica control technology, a video on crystalline silica and silicosis, and informational cards for workers explaining crystalline silica, health effects related to exposure, and methods of control. The SEP provided guidance for targeting inspections of worksites with employees at risk of developing silicosis., 864764=Based on ERG (2007b), OSHA derived unit cost estimates for establishing and maintaining regulated areas to comply with these requirements and estimated that one area would be necessary for every eight workers in general industry and maritime exposed above the PEL. Unit costs include planning time (estimated at eight hours of supervisor time annually); material costs for signs and boundary markers (annualized at $63.64 in 2009 dollars); and costs of $500 annually for two disposable respirators per day to be used by authorized persons (other than those who regularly work in the regulated area) who might need to enter the area in the course of their job duties. In addition, for costing purposes, OSHA estimates that, in response to the protective work clothing requirements in regulated areas, ten percent of employees in regulated areas would wear disposable protective clothing daily, estimated at $5.50 per suit, for an annual clothing cost of $1,100 per regulated area. Tables V-16 in the PEA shows the cost assumptions and unit costs applied in OSHA's cost model for regulated areas in general industry and maritime. Overall, OSHA estimates that each regulated area would, on average, cost employers $1,732 annually in general industry and maritime., 833857=Below, OSHA summarizes its methodology for estimating unit and total costs for the major provisions required under the proposed silica standard. For a full presentation of the cost analysis, see Chapter V of the PEA and ERG (2007a, 2007b, 2011, 2013). OSHA invites comment on all aspects of its preliminary cost analysis., 332891=OSHA believes that the current epidemiological literature provides little, if any, support for treating cristobalite as presenting a greater lung cancer risk than comparable exposure to respirable quartz. Furthermore, the weight of the available toxicological literature no longer supports the hypothesis that cristobalite has a higher toxicity than quartz, and quantitative estimates of lung cancer risk do not suggest that cristobalite is more carcinogenic than quartz. (See Section I.F of the background document, Physical Factors that May Influence Toxicity of Crystalline Silica, for a fuller discussion of this issue.) OSHA preliminary concludes that respirable cristobalite and quartz dust have similar potencies for increasing lung cancer risk. Both IARC (1997) and NIOSH (2002) reached similar conclusions., 742928=To demonstrate the limits of feasibility, OSHA's analysis examines the technological feasibility of the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3, as well as the technological feasibility of an alternative PEL of 25 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3. In total, OSHA analyzed technological feasibility in 108 operations in general industry, maritime, and construction industries. This analysis addresses two different aspects of technological feasibility: (1) The extent to which engineering controls can reduce and maintain exposures; and (2) the capability of existing sampling and analytical methods to measure silica exposures. The discussion below summarizes the findings in Chapter IV of the PEA (see Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034)., 424051=The Mannetje et al. (2002b) silicosis analysis was part of the IARC ten cohort pooled study included in the Steenland et al. (2001a) lung cancer mortality analysis above. These studies included 18,634 subjects and 170 silicosis deaths (n = 150 for silicosis, and n = 20 unspecified pneumoconiosis). The silicosis deaths had a median duration of exposure of 28 years, a median cumulative exposure of 7.2 mg/m3-years, and a median average exposure of 0.26 mg/m3, while the respective values of the whole cohort were 10 years, 0.62 mg/m3-years, and 0.07 mg/m3. Rates for silicosis adjusted for age, calendar time, and study were estimated by Poisson regression; rates increased nearly monotonically with deciles of cumulative exposure, from a mortality rate of 5/100,000 person-years in the lowest exposure category (0-0.99 mg/m3-years) to 299/100,000 person-years in the highest category (>28.10 mg/m3-years). Quantitative estimates of exposure to respirable silica (mg/m3) were available for all six cohorts (Mannetje et al. 2002a). Lifetime risk of silicosis mortality was estimated by accumulating mortality rates over time using the formula, 419503=For this cohort mortality study there were analyses using both external (regional age-time and cause specific mortality rates) internal controls. For the analysis from external mortality rates, the all-cause mortality SMR from 1959 through 2005 was 100.9 (95% C.I., 99.0-102.8), based on all 10,698 deaths. However, these death ratios were not uniform over time. For the period from 1990 to 2005, the all-cause SMR was 109.6 (95% C.I., 106.5-112.8), while the ratios for previous periods were less than 100. This pattern of recent increasing SMRs was also seen in the recent cause-specific death rate for lung cancer, SMR=115.7 (95% C.I., 104.8-127.7). For the analysis based on internal rates and using Cox regression methods, the relative risk for lung cancer risk based on a cumulative quartz exposure equivalent to approximately 0.055 mg/m3for 45 years was RR = 1.14 (95% C.I., 1.04 to 1.25). This risk is adjusted for concurrent coal dust exposure and smoking status, and incorporated a 15-year lag in quartz exposures. The analysis showed a strong effect for smoking (independent of quartz exposure) on lung cancer. For lung cancer, OSHA believes that the analyses based on the Cox regression method provides strong evidence that for these coal miners' quartz exposures were associated with increased lung cancer risk, but that simultaneous exposures to coal dust did not cause increased lung cancer risk. To estimate lung cancer risk from this study, OSHA estimated the regression slope for a log-linear relative risk model based on the Miller and MacCalman's (2009) finding of a relative risk of 1.14 for a cumulative exposure of 0.055 mg/m3-years., 147920=OSHA's preliminary risk assessment indicates that significant risk remains at the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3. Where there is continuing significant risk, the decision in the Asbestos case (Bldg. and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1988)) indicated that OSHA should use its legal authority to impose additional requirements on employers to further reduce risk when those requirements will result in a greater than de minimis incremental benefit to workers' health. OSHA's preliminary conclusion is that the requirements triggered by the action level will result in a very real and necessary, but non-quantifiable, further reduction in risk beyond that provided by the PEL alone. OSHA's choice of proposing an action level for exposure monitoring of one-half of the PEL is based on the Agency's successful experience with other standards, including those for inorganic arsenic (29 CFR 1910.1018), ethylene oxide (29 CFR 1910.1047), benzene (29 CFR 1910.1028), and methylene chloride (29 CFR 1910.1052)., 52525=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 360977=Wyndham et al. (1986) found a significant excess mortality for chronic respiratory diseases in a cohort of white South African gold miners. Although these data did include silicosis mortality, the authors found evidence demonstrating that none of the miners certified on the death certificate as dying from silicosis actually died from that disease. Instead, pneumoconiosis was always an incidental finding in those dying from some other cause, the most common of which was chronic obstructive lung disease. A case-referent analysis found that, although the major risk factor for chronic respiratory disease was smoking, there was a statistically significant additional effect of cumulative dust exposure, with the relative risk estimated to be 2.48 per ten units of 1000 particle years of exposure., 431211=The combined cohort for the pooled analysis (Steenland et al., 2002a) consisted of 13,382 workers with exposure information available for 12,783 (95 percent). Exposure matrices for the three cohorts had been used in previous studies (Steenland and Brown, 1995a; Attfield and Costello, 2001; Steenland et al., 2001b). The mean duration of exposure, the mean cumulative exposure, and the mean concentration of respirable silica for the pooled cohort were 13.6 years, 1.2 mg/m3-years, and 0.07 mg/m3, respectively. SMRs (compared to the U.S. population) for renal disease (acute and chronic glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute and chronic renal failure, renal sclerosis, and nephritis/nephropathy) were statistically significantly elevated using multiple cause data (SMR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10-1.47, 193 deaths) and underlying cause data (SMR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.85, 51 observed deaths)., 253723=In January 2010, OSHA completed a peer review of the draft Health Effects analysis and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment following procedures set forth by OMB in the Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review, published on the OMB Web site on December 16, 2004 (see 70 FR 2664, Jan. 14, 2005). Each peer reviewer submitted a written report to OSHA. The Agency revised its draft documents as appropriate and made the revised documents available to the public as part of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. OSHA also made the written charge to the peer reviewers, the peer reviewers' names, the peer reviewers' reports, and the Agency's response to the peer reviewers' reports publicly available with publication of this proposed rule. OSHA will schedule time during the informal rulemaking hearing for participants to testify on the Health Effects analysis and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment in the presence of peer reviewers and will request the peer reviewers to submit any amended final comments they may wish to add to the record. The Agency will consider amended final comments received from the peer reviewers during development of a final rule and will make them publicly available as part of the silica rulemaking record., 413882=McDonald et al. (2001), Hughes et al. (2001) and McDonald et al. (2005) followed up on a cohort study of North American industrial sand workers that overlapped with the industrial sand cohort (18 plants, 4,626 workers) studied by Steenland and Sanderson (2001) and included in Steenland et al.'s (2001a) pooled cohort analysis. The McDonald et al. (2001) follow-up cohort included 2,670 men employed before 1980 for three years or more in one of nine North American (8 U.S. and 1 Canadian) sand-producing plants, including 1 large associated office complex. Information on cause of death was obtained, from 1960 through 1994, for 99 percent of the deceased workers for a total 1,025 deaths representing 38 percent of the cohort. A nested case-control study and analysis based on 90 lung cancer deaths from this cohort was also conducted by Hughes et al. (2001). A later update through 2000, of both the cohort and nested case-control studies by McDonald et al. (2005), eliminated the Canadian plant, following 2,452 men from the eight U.S. plants. For the lung cancer case-control part of the study the update included 105 lung cancer deaths. Both the initial and updated case control studies used up to two controls per case., 111964=Fax: If your written submission does not exceed 10 pages, including attachments, you may fax it to the OSHA Docket Office at (202) 693-1648., 204812=53. The proposed standards do not contain a requirement for a written exposure control program. The two ASTM standards for general industry and construction (E 1132-06, section 4.2.6, and E 2626-09, section 4.2.5) state that, where overexposures are persistent (such as in regulated areas or abrasive blasting operations), a written exposure control plan shall establish engineering and administrative controls to bring the area into compliance, if feasible. In addition, the proposed regulatory language developed by the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO contains provisions for a written program. The ASTM standards recommend that, where there are regulated areas with persistent exposures or tasks, tools, or operations that tend to cause respirable crystalline silica exposure, the employer will conduct a formal analysis and implement a written control plan (an abatement plan) on how to bring the process into compliance. If that is not feasible, the employer is to indicate the respiratory protection and other protective procedures that will be used to protect employee(s) permanently or until compliance will be achieved. Should OSHA require employers to develop and implement a written exposure control plan and, if so, what should be required to be in the plans?, 492894=Silicosis is the oldest known occupational lung disease and is still today the cause of significant premature mortality. In 2005, there were 161 deaths in the U.S. where silicosis was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death on a death certificate (NIOSH, 2008c). Between 1996 and 2005, deaths attributed to silicosis resulted in an average of 11.6 years of life lost by affected workers (NIOSH, 2007). In addition, exposure to respirable crystalline silica remains an important cause of morbidity and hospitalizations. State-based hospital discharge data show that in the year 2000, 1,128 silicosis-related hospitalizations occurred, indicating that silicosis continues to be a significant health issue in the U.S. (CSTE, 2005). Although there is no national silicosis disease surveillance system in the U.S., a published analysis of state-based surveillance data from the time period 1987-1996 estimated that between 3,600-7,000 new cases of silicosis occurred in the U.S. each year (Rosenman et al., 2003). It has been widely reported that available statistics on silicosis-related mortality and morbidity are likely to be understated due to misclassification of causes of death (for example, as tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or cor pulmonale), errors in recording occupation on death certificates, or misdiagnosis of disease by health care providers (Goodwin, 2003; Windau et al., 1991; Rosenman et al., 2003). Furthermore, reliance on chest x-ray findings may miss cases of silicosis because fibrotic changes in the lung may not be visible on chest radiograph; thus, silicosis may be present absent x-ray signs or may be more severe than indicated by x-ray (Hnizdo et al., 1993; Craighead and Vallyathan, 1980; Rosenman et al., 1997)., 487682=Section I of OSHA's Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (available in Docket OSHA-2010-0034) describes in detail the adverse health conditions that workers who are exposed to respirable crystalline silica are at risk of developing. The Agency's findings are summarized in Section V of this preamble (Health Effects Summary). The adverse health effects discussed include lung cancer, silicosis, other non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD), and immunological and renal effects., 889428=The annualized costs per affected establishment for each affected industry were calculated by distributing the industry-level (incremental) annualized compliance costs among all affected establishments in the industry, where costs were annualized using a 7 percent discount rate. The annualized cost of the proposed rule for the average establishment in all of general industry and maritime is estimated at $2,571 in 2009 dollars. It is clear from Table VIII-11 that the estimates of the annualized costs per affected establishment in general industry and maritime vary widely from industry to industry. These estimates range from $40,468 for NAICS 327111 (Vitreous china plumbing fixtures and bathroom accessories manufacturing) and $38,422 for NAICS 327121 (Brick and structural clay manufacturing) to $107 for NAICS 325510 (Paint and coating manufacturing) and $49 for NAICS 621210 (Dental offices)., 222023=82. OSHA is providing an abbreviated training section in this proposal as compared to ASTM consensus standards (see ASTM E 1132-06, sections 4.8.1-5). The Hazard Communication standard is comprehensive and covers most of the training requirements traditionally included in an OSHA health standard. Do you concur with OSHA that performance-based training specified in the Hazard Communication standard, supplemented by the few training requirements of this section, is sufficient in its scope and depth? Are there any other training provisions you would add?, 438405=The average respirable dust exposure for the cohort overall was 0.29 mg/m3(range 0.11-0.47), corresponding to an estimated average respirable silica concentration of 0.09 mg/m3(range 0.033-0.14). The average cumulative dust exposure for the overall cohort was 6.6 mg/m3-years (range 1.2-18.7), or an average cumulative silica exposure of 1.98 mg/m3-years (range 0.36-5.61). OSHA believes that the exposure estimates for the cohort are uncertain given the need to rely on particle count data generated over a fairly narrow production period., 433414=The International Labour Organization's (ILO) 1980 International Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses is accepted as the standard against which chest radiographs are measured in epidemiologic studies, for medical surveillance and for clinical evaluation. According to this standard, if radiographic findings are or may be consistent with pneumoconiosis, then the size, shape, and extent of profusion of opacities are characterized by comparing the radiograph to standard films. Classification by shape (rounded vs. irregular) and size involves identifying primary and secondary types of small opacities on the radiograph and classifying them into one of six size/shape categories. The extent of profusion is judged from the concentrations of opacities as compared with that on the standard radiographs and is graded on a 12-point scale of four major categories (0-3, with Category 0 representing absence of opacities), each with three subcategories. Most of the studies reviewed by OSHA considered a finding consistent with an ILO classification of 1/1 to be a positive diagnosis of silicosis, although some also considered an x-ray classification of 1/0 or 0/1 to be positive., 281984=Data on the prevalence of silicosis morbidity are available from only three states (Michigan, Ohio, and New Jersey) that have administered disease surveillance programs over the past several years. These programs rely primarily on hospital discharge records, reporting of cases from the medical community, workers' compensation programs, and death certificate data. For the reporting period 1993-2002, the last year for which data are available, three states (Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio) recorded 879 cases of silicosis (NIOSH 2008c). Hospital discharge records represent the primary ascertainment source for all three states. It should be noted that hospital discharge records most likely include cases of acute silicosis or very advance chronic silicosis since it is unlikely that there would be a need for hospitalization in cases with early radiographic signs of silicosis, such as for an ILO category 1/0 x-ray. Nationwide hospital discharge data compiled by NIOSH (2008c) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE, 2005) indicates that there are at least 1,000 hospitalizations each year due to silicosis., 53224=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National ArchivesÃ¢Â€Â™ McGowan Theater. What exactly is a Federal... Continue reading Ã¢Â†Â’, 445861=Chen et al. (2001) reported the results of a retrospective study of a Chinese cohort of 3,010 underground miners who had worked in tin mines at least one year between 1960 and 1965. They were followed through 1994, by which time 2,426 (80.6%) workers had either retired or died, and only 400 (13.3%) remained employed at the mines., 335366=In their 2002 hazard review of respirable crystalline silica, NIOSH identified numerous epidemiological studies and reported statistically significant increases in death rates due to gastric or stomach cancer. OSHA preliminarily concurs with observations made previously by Cocco et al. (1996) and the NIOSH (2002) crystalline silica hazard review that the vast majority of epidemiology studies of silica and stomach cancer have not sufficiently adjusted for the effects of confounding factors or have not been sufficiently designed to assess a dose-response relationship (e.g., Finkelstein and Verma, 2005; Moshammer and Neuberger, 2004; Selikoff, 1978, Stern et al., 2001). Other studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant dose-response relationship (e.g., Calvert et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2001). Therefore, OSHA believes the evidence is insufficient to conclude that silica is a gastric carcinogen., 112739=Instructions: All submissions must include the Agency name and docket number for this rulemaking (Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034).

Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasized the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The full PEA has been placed in OSHA rulemaking docket OSHA-2010-0034. This rule is an economically significant regulatory action under Sec. 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and has been reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, as required by executive order., 540573=Somewhat higher risk estimates are derived from the analysis presented by Attfield and Costello (2004) of Vermont granite workers. This study involved a cohort of 5,414 male granite workers who were employed in the Vermont granite industry between 1950 and 1982 and who were followed through 1994. Workers' cumulative exposures were estimated by Davis et al. (1983) based on historical exposure data collected in six environmental surveys conducted between 1924 and 1977. A categorical analysis showed an increasing trend of lung cancer risk ratios with increasing exposure, and Poisson regression was used to evaluate several exposure-response models with varying exposure lags and use of either untransformed or log-transformed exposure metrics. The best-fitting model was based on use of a 15-year lag, use of untransformed cumulative exposure, and omission of the highest exposure group. The investigators believed that the omission of the highest exposure group was appropriate since: (1) The underlying exposure data for the high-exposure group was weaker than for the others; (2) there was a greater likelihood that competing causes of death and misdiagnoses of causes of death attenuated the lung cancer death rate in the highest exposure group; (3) all of the remaining groups comprised 85 percent of the deaths in the cohort and showed a strong linear increase in lung cancer mortality with increasing exposure; and (4) the exposure-response relationship seen in the lower exposure groups was more relevant given that the exposures of these groups were within the range of current occupational standards. OSHA's use of the exposure coefficient from this analysis in a log-linear relative risk model yielded a risk estimate of 60 deaths per 1,000 workers for 45 years of exposure to the current general industry PEL of 0.1 mg/m3, 25 deaths per 1,000 for 45 years of exposure to the proposed PEL of 0.05 mg/m3, and 11 deaths per 1,000 for 45 years of exposure at the proposed action level of 0.025 mg/m3. Estimated risks associated with 45 years of exposure at the current construction PEL range from 250 to 653 deaths per 1,000., 337909=In 2002, NIOSH conducted a thorough literature review of the health effects potentially associated with crystalline silica exposure including a review of lung cancer and other carcinogens. NIOSH noted that for workers who may have been exposed to crystalline silica, there have been infrequent reports of statistically significant excesses of deaths for other cancers. A summary of these cancer studies as cited in NIOSH (2002) have been reported in the following organ systems (see NIOSH, 2002 for full bibliographic references): salivary gland; liver; bone; pancreatic; skin; lymphopoetic or hematopoietic; brain; and bladder., 286130=The study reflecting average exposures most similar to current exposure conditions is that of Miller et al. (1998), which followed a group of 547 British coal miners in 1990-1991 to evaluate chest x-ray changes that had occurred after the mines closed in 1981. This study had data available from chest x-rays taken during health surveys conducted between 1954 and 1978, as well as data from extensive exposure monitoring conducted between 1964 and 1978. The mean and maximum cumulative exposure reported in the study correspond to average concentrations of 0.12 and 0.55 mg/m3, respectively, over the 15-year sampling period. However, between 1971 and 1976, workers experienced unusually high concentrations of respirable quartz in one of the two coal seams in which the miners worked. For some occupations, quarterly mean quartz concentrations ranged from 1 to 3 mg/m3, and for a brief period, concentrations exceeded 10 mg/m3for one job. Some of these high exposures likely contributed to the extent of disease progression seen in these workers; in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment, OSHA reviewed a study by Buchanan et al. (2003), who found that short-term exposures to high (>2 mg/m3) concentrations of silica can increase the silicosis risk by 3-fold over what would be predicted by cumulative exposure alone (see Section VI)., 384664=The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act or Act) and some landmark court cases have led OSHA to rely on quantitative risk assessment, to the extent possible, to support the risk determinations required to set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for a toxic substance in standards under the OSH Act. A determining factor in the decision to perform a quantitative risk assessment is the availability of suitable data for such an assessment. In the case of crystalline silica, there has been extensive research on its health effects, and several quantitative risk assessments have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature that describe the risk to exposed workers of lung cancer mortality, silicosis mortality and morbidity, non-malignant respiratory disease mortality, and renal disease mortality. These assessments were based on several studies of occupational cohorts in a variety of industry sectors, the underlying studies of which are described in OSHA's review of the health effects literature (see section V of this preamble). In this section, OSHA summarizes its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) for crystalline silica, which is presented in Section II of the background document entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœRespirable Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€Â”Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk AssessmentÃ¢Â€? (placed in Docket OSHA-2010-0034)., 362817=Park et al. (2002) analyzed the California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally studied by Checkoway et al. (1997), consisting of 2,570 diatomaceous earth workers employed for 12 months or more from 1942 to 1994, to quantify the relationship between exposure to cristobalite and mortality from chronic lung disease other than cancer (LDOC). Diseases in this category included pneumoconiosis (which included silicosis), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, but excluded pneumonia and other infectious diseases. Smoking information was available for about 50 percent of the cohort and for 22 of the 67 LDOC deaths available for analysis, permitting Park et al. (2002) to at least partially adjust for smoking. Using the exposure estimates developed for the cohort by Rice et al. (2001) in their exposure-response study of lung cancer risks, Park et al. (2002) evaluated the quantitative exposure-response relationship for LDOC mortality and found a strong positive relationship with exposure to respirable crystalline silica. OSHA finds this study particularly compelling because of the strengths of the study design and availability of smoking history data on part of the cohort and high-quality exposure and job history data; consequently, OSHA has included this study in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment., 108195=Mail, hand delivery, express mail, messenger, or courier service: You must submit your comments to the OSHA Docket Office, Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2625, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210, telephone (202) 693-2350 (OSHA's TTY number is (877) 889-5627). Deliveries (hand, express mail, messenger, or courier service) are accepted during the Department of Labor's and Docket Office's normal business hours, 8:15 a.m.-4:45 p.m., E.T., 157498=Both industry and worker groups have recognized that a comprehensive standard is needed to protect workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica. For example, the industry consensus standards for crystalline silica, ASTM E 1132-06, Standard Practice for Health Requirements Relating to Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica, and ASTM E 2626-09, Standard Practice for Controlling Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica for Construction and Demolition Activities, as well as the draft proposed silica standard for construction developed by the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, have each included comprehensive programs. These recommended standards include provisions for methods of compliance, exposure monitoring, training, and medical surveillance (ASTM, 2006; 2009; BCTD 2001). Moreover, as mentioned previously, where there is continuing significant risk, the decision in the Asbestos case (Bldg. and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1988)) indicated that OSHA should use its legal authority to impose additional requirements on employers to further reduce risk when those requirements will result in a greater than de minimis incremental benefit to workers' health. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the additional requirements in the ancillary provisions of the proposed standard clearly exceed this threshold., 272677=The clinical diagnosis of silicosis has three requisites (Balaan and Banks, 1992; Banks, 2005). The first is the recognition by the physician that exposure to crystalline silica adequate to cause this disease has occurred. The second is the presence of chest radiographic abnormalities consistent with silicosis. The third is the absence of other illnesses that could resemble silicosis on chest radiograph, e.g., pulmonary fungal infection or miliary tuberculosis. To describe the presence and severity of silicosis from chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images, a standardized system exists to classify the opacities seen on chest radiographs (the International Labor Organization (ILO) International Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses (ILO, 1980, 2002, 2011; Merchant and Schwartz, 1998; NIOSH, 2011). This system standardizes the description of chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images with respect to the size, shape, and density of opacities, which together indicate the severity and extent of lung involvement. The density of opacities seen on chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images is classified on a 4-point major category scale (0, 1, 2, or 3), with each major category divided into three subcategories, giving a 12-point scale between 0/0 and 3/+. (For each subcategory, the top number indicates the major category that the profusion most closely resembles, and the bottom number indicates the major category that was given secondary consideration.) Major category 0 indicates the absence of visible opacities and categories 1 to 3 reflect increasing profusion of opacities and a concomitant increase in severity of disease. Biopsy is not necessary to make a diagnosis and a diagnosis does not require that chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images be rated using the ILO system (NIOSH, 2002). In addition, an assessment of pulmonary function, though not itself necessary to confirm a diagnosis of silicosis, is important to evaluate whether the individual has impaired lung function., 405113=Rice et al. (2001) applied a variety of exposure-response models to the same California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally reported on by Checkoway et al. (1993, 1996, 1997) and included in the pooled analysis conducted by Steenland et al. (2001a) described above. The cohort consisted of 2,342 white males employed for at least one year between 1942 and 1987 in a California diatomaceous earth mining and processing plant. The cohort was followed until 1994, and included 77 lung cancer deaths. Rice et al. (2001) relied on the dust exposure assessment developed by Seixas et al. (1997) from company records of over 6,000 samples collected from 1948 to 1988; cristobalite was the predominate form of crystalline silica to which the cohort was exposed. Analysis was based on both Poisson regression models Cox's proportional hazards models with various functions of cumulative silica exposure in mg/m3-years to estimate the relationship between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality rate. Rice et al. (2001) reported that exposure to crystalline silica was a significant predictor of lung cancer mortality for nearly all of the models employed, with the linear relative risk model providing the best fit to the data in the Poisson regression analysis., 137758=Because respirators are less reliable than engineering and work practice controls and may create additional problems, OSHA believes that primary reliance on respirators to protect workers is generally inappropriate when feasible engineering and work practice controls are available. All OSHA substance-specific health standards have recognized and required employers to observe the hierarchy of controls, favoring engineering and work practice controls over respirators. OSHA's PELs, including the current PELs for respirable crystalline silica, also incorporate this hierarchy of controls. In addition, the industry consensus standards for crystalline silica (ASTM E 1132-06, Standard Practice for Health Requirements Relating to Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica, and ASTM E 2626-09, Standard Practice for Controlling Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica for Construction and Demolition Activities) incorporate the hierarchy of controls., 426194=Park et al. (2002) analyzed the California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally studied by Checkoway et al. (1997), consisting of 2,570 diatomaceous earth workers employed for 12 months or more from 1942 to 1994, to quantify the relationship between exposure to cristobalite and mortality from chronic lung disease other than cancer (LDOC). Diseases in this category included pneumoconiosis (which included silicosis), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, but excluded pneumonia and other infectious diseases. Industrial hygiene data for the cohort were available from the employer for total dust, silica (mostly cristobalite), and asbestos. Park et al. (2002) used the exposure assessment previously reported by Seixas et al. (1997) and used by Rice et al. (2001) to estimate cumulative crystalline silica exposures for each worker in the cohort based on detailed work history files. The mean silica concentration for the cohort overall was 0.29 mg/m3over the period of employment (Seixas et al., 1997). The mean cumulative exposure values for total respirable dust and respirable crystalline silica were 7.31 and 2.16 mg/m3-year, respectively. Similar cumulative exposure estimates were made for asbestos. Smoking information was available for about 50 percent of the cohort and for 22 of the 67 LDOC deaths available for analysis, permitting Park et al. (2002) to at least partially adjust for smoking. Estimates of LDOC mortality risks were derived via Poisson and Cox's proportional hazards models; a variety of relative rate model forms were fit to the data, with a linear relative rate model being selected for risk estimation., 230604=With respect to economic feasibility, the courts have held that a standard is feasible if it does not threaten massive dislocation to or imperil the existence of the industry. Id. at 1265. A court must examine the cost of compliance with an OSHA standard,, 490380=The diagnosis of silicosis is based on a history of exposure to respirable crystalline silica, chest radiograph findings, and the exclusion of other conditions, including tuberculosis (TB). Because workers affected by early stages of chronic silicosis are often asymptomatic, the finding of opacities in the lung is key to detecting silicosis and characterizing its severity. The International Labour Organization (ILO) International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses (ILO, 1980, 2002, 2011) is the currently accepted standard against which chest radiographs are evaluated in epidemiologic studies, for medical surveillance, and for clinical evaluation. The ILO system standardizes the description of chest x-rays, and is based on a 12-step scale of severity and extent of silicosis as evidenced by the size, shape, and density of opacities seen on the x-ray film. Profusion (frequency) of small opacities is classified on a 4-point major category scale (0-3), with each major category divided into three, giving a 12-point scale between 0/Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ and 3/+. Large opacities are defined as any opacity greater than 1 cm that is present in a film., 539088=Rice et al. (2001) presents an exposure-response analysis of the diatomaceous worker cohort studied by Checkoway et al. (1993, 1996, 1997), who found a significant relationship between exposure to respirable cristobalite and increased lung cancer mortality. The cohort consisted of 2,342 white males employed for at least one year between 1942 and 1987 in a California diatomaceous earth mining and processing plant. The cohort was followed until 1994, and included 77 lung cancer deaths. The risk analysis relied on an extensive job-specific exposure assessment developed by Sexias et al. (1997), which included use of over 6,000 samples taken during the period 1948 through 1988. The mean cumulative exposure for the cohort was 2.16 mg/m3-years for respirable crystalline silica dust. Rice et al. (2001) evaluated several model forms for the exposure-response analysis and found exposure to respirable cristobalite to be a significant predictor of lung cancer mortality with the best-fitting model being a linear relative risk model (with a 15-year exposure lag). From this model, the estimates of the excess risk of lung cancer mortality are 34, 17, and 9 deaths per 1,000 workers for 45-years of exposure to 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mg/m3, respectively. For exposures in the range of the current construction and shipyard PELs over 45 years, estimated risks lie in a range between 81 and 152 deaths per 1,000 workers., 124420=OSHA directed InforumÃ¢Â€Â”a not-for-profit corporation (based at the University of Maryland) well recognized for its macroeconomic modelingÃ¢Â€Â”to run its LIFT (Long-term Interindustry Forecasting Tool) model of the U.S. economy to estimate the industry and aggregate employment effects of the proposed silica rule. Inforum developed estimates of the employment impacts over the ten-year period from 2014-2023 by feeding OSHA's year-by-year and industry-by-industry estimates of the compliance costs of the proposed rule into its LIFT model. Based on the resulting Inforum estimates of employment impacts, OSHA has preliminarily concluded that the proposed rule would have a negligibleÃ¢Â€Â”albeit slightly positiveÃ¢Â€Â”net impact on aggregate U.S. employment., 221133=81. OSHA has proposed that employers provide hazard information to employees in accordance with the Agency's Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Compliance with the Hazard Communication standard would mean that there would be a requirement for a warning label for substances that contain more than 0.1 percent crystalline silica. Should this requirement be changed so that warning labels would only be required of substances more than 1 percent by weight of silica? Provide the rationale for your position. The Agency also has proposed additional training specific to work with respirable crystalline silica. Should OSHA include these additional requirements in the final rule, or are the requirements of the Hazard Communication standard sufficient?, 279847=NIOSH cited two main factors that were likely responsible for the declining trend in silicosis mortality since 1968. First, many of the deaths in the early part of the study period occurred among persons whose main exposure to crystalline silica dust probably occurred before introduction of national standards for silica dust exposure established by OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) (i.e., permissible exposure limits (PELs)) that likely led to reduced silica dust exposure. Second, there has been declining employment in heavy industries (e.g., foundries) where silica exposure was prevalent (CDC, 2005). Although the factors described by NIOSH are reasonable explanations for the steep reduction in silicosis-related mortality, it should be emphasized that the surveillance data are insufficient for the analysis of residual risk associated with current occupational exposure limits for crystalline silica. Analyses designed to explore this question must make use of appropriate exposure-response data, as is presented in OSHA's Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (summarized in Section VI of this preamble)., 281075=Although the number of deaths from silicosis overall has declined since 1968, the number of silicosis-associated deaths reported among persons aged 15 to 44 had not declined substantially prior to 1995 (CDC 1998). Unfortunately, it is not known to what extent these deaths among younger workers were caused by acute or accelerated forms of silicosis., 252647=Throughout the crystalline silica rulemaking process, OSHA has presented information to, and has consulted with, the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) and the Maritime Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health (MACOSH). In December of 2009, OSHA representatives met with ACCSH to discuss the rulemaking and receive their comments and recommendations. On December 11, ACCSH passed motions supporting the concept of Table 1 in the draft proposed construction rule and recognizing that the controls listed in Table 1 are effective. (As discussed with regard to paragraph (f) of the proposed rule, Table 1 presents specified control measures for selected construction operations.) ACCSH also recommended that OSHA maintain the protective clothing provision found in the SBREFA panel draft regulatory text and restore the Ã¢Â€Âœcompetent personÃ¢Â€? requirement and responsibilities to the proposed rule. Additionally, the group recommended that OSHA move forward expeditiously with the rulemaking process., 53164=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 53832=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 351730=A review published by NIOSH in 2002 discussed studies related to silica exposure and development of chronic bronchitis. NIOSH concluded, based on the same studies reviewed by OSHA, that occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica is associated with bronchitis, but that some epidemiologic studies suggested that this effect may be less frequent or absent in non-smokers., 236128=In December 1974, OSHA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) based on the recommendations in the NIOSH criteria document (39 FR 44771, Dec. 27, 1974). In the ANPRM, OSHA solicited Ã¢Â€Âœpublic participation on the issues of whether a new standard for crystalline silica should be issued on the basis of the [NIOSH] criteria or any other information, and, if so, what should be the contents of a proposed standard for crystalline silica.Ã¢Â€? OSHA also set forth the particular issues of concern on which comments were requested. The Agency did not pursue a final rule for crystalline silica at that time., 843344=OSHA's cost estimates assume that implementation of the recommended silica controls prevents workers in general industry and maritime from being exposed over the PEL in most cases. Specifically, based on its technological feasibility analysis, OSHA expects that the technical controls are adequate to keep silica exposures at or below the PEL for an alternative PEL of 100 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3(introduced for economic analysis purposes). [17] For the proposed 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3PEL, OSHA's feasibility analysis suggests that the controls that employers use, either because of technical limitations or imperfect implementation, might not be adequate in all cases to ensure that worker exposures in all affected job categories are at or below 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3. For this preliminary cost analysis, OSHA estimates that ten percent of the at-risk workers in general industry would require respirators, at least occasionally, after the implementation of engineering controls to achieve compliance with the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3. For workers in maritime, the only activity with silica exposures above the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3is abrasive blasting, and maritime workers engaged in abrasive blasting are already required to use respirators under the existing OSHA ventilation standard (29 CFR 1910.94(a)). Therefore, OSHA has estimated no additional costs for maritime workers to use respirators as a result of the proposed silica rule., 440641=Exposure was estimated by conversion of impinger (particle count) data and was based on measurements indicating an average of 13 percent silica in the dust. Based on these data, the authors estimated the mean exposure concentration to be 0.05 mg/m3for the overall cohort, with those hired before 1930 exposed to an average of 0.15 mg/m3. The average duration of exposure for cases was 20 years (s.d = 8.7) compared to 8.2 years (s.d = 7.9) for the rest of the cohort. This study found that cumulative exposure was the best disease predictor, followed by duration of exposure and average exposure. Lifetime risks were estimated from Poisson regression models using standard life table techniques. The authors estimated a risk of 47 percent associated with 45 years of exposure to 0.09 mg/m3respirable crystalline silica, which reduced to 35 percent after adjustment for age and calendar time., 545010=Miller and MacCalman (2010, also reported in Miller et al., 2007) extended the follow-up of a previously published cohort mortality study (Miller and Buchanan, 1997). The follow-up study included 17,800 miners from 10 coal mines in the U.K. who were followed through the end of 2005; observation in the original study began in 1970. By 2005, there were 516,431 person years of observation, an average of 29 years per miner, with 10,698 deaths from all causes. Exposure estimates of cohort members were not updated from the earlier study since the mines closed in the 1980s; however, some of these men might have had additional exposure at other mines or facilities. An analysis of cause-specific mortality was performed using external controls; it demonstrated that lung cancer mortality was statistically significantly elevated for coal miners exposed to silica. An analysis using internal controls was performed via Cox proportional hazards regression methods, which allowed for each individual miner's measurements of age and smoking status, as well as the individual's detailed dust and quartz time-dependent exposure measurements. From the Cox regression, Miller and MacCalman (2009) estimated that cumulative exposure of 5 g-h/m3respirable quartz (incorporating a 15-year lag) was associated with a relative risk of 1.14 for lung cancer. This cumulative exposure is about equivalent to 45 years of exposure to 0.055 mg/m3respirable quartz, or a cumulative exposure of 2.25 mg/m3-yr, assuming 2,000 hours of exposure per year. OSHA applied this slope factor in a log-relative risk model and estimated the lifetime lung cancer mortality risk to be 13 per 1,000 for 45 years of exposure to 0.1 mg/m3respirable crystalline silica. For the proposed PEL of 0.05 mg/m3and proposed action level of 0.025 mg/m3, the lifetime risks are estimated to be 6 and 3 deaths per 1,000, respectively. The range of risks estimated to result from 45 years of exposure to the current construction and shipyard PELs is from 37 to 95 deaths per 1,000 workers., 305067=A series of studies of the diatomaceous earth industry (Checkoway et al., 1993, 1996, 1997, 1999) demonstrated positive exposure-response trends between cristobalite exposures and lung cancer as well as non-malignant respiratory disease mortality (NMRD). Checkoway et al. (1993) developed a Ã¢Â€Âœsemi-quantitativeÃ¢Â€? cumulative exposure estimate that demonstrated a statistically significant positive exposure-response trend (p = 0.026) between duration of employment or cumulative exposure and lung cancer mortality. The quartile analysis showed a monotonic increase in lung cancer mortality, with the highest exposure quartile having a RR of 2.74 for lung cancer mortality. Checkoway et al. (1996) conducted a re-analysis to address criticisms of potential confounding due to asbestos and again demonstrated a positive exposure response risk gradient when controlling for asbestos exposure and other variables. Rice et al. (2001) conducted a re-analysis and quantitative risk assessment of the Checkoway et al. (1997) study, which OSHA has included as part of its assessment of lung cancer mortality risk (See Section II, Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment)., 287586=Among the 504 workers whose last chest x-ray was classified as ILO 0/0 or 0/1, 20 percent had experienced onset of silicosis (i.e., chest x-ray was classified as ILO 1/0 by the time of follow up in 1990-1991), and 4.8 percent progressed to at least category 2. However, there are no data available to continue following the progression of this group because there have been no follow-up surveys of this cohort since 1991., 119161=OSHA currently enforces permissible exposure limits (PELs) for respirable crystalline silica in general industry, construction, and shipyards. These PELs were adopted in 1971, shortly after the Agency was created, and have not been updated since then. The PEL for quartz (the most common form of crystalline silica) in general industry is a formula that is approximately equivalent to 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ÃŽÂ¼g/m3) as an 8-hour time-weighted average. The PEL for quartz in construction and shipyards is a formula based on a now-obsolete particle count sampling method that is approximately equivalent to 250 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3. The current PELs for two other forms of crystalline silica (cristobalite and tridymite) are one-half of the values for quartz in general industry. OSHA is proposing a new PEL for respirable crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite) of 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3in all industry sectors covered by the rule. OSHA is also proposing other elements of a comprehensive health standard, including requirements for exposure assessment, preferred methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping., 231550=The courts have further observed that granting companies reasonable time to comply with new PELs may enhance economic feasibility. The Lead I case at 1265. While a standard must be economically feasible, the Supreme Court has held that a cost-benefit analysis of health standards is not required by the Act because a feasibility analysis is required. The Cotton Dust case, 453 U.S. at 509., 127023=Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has been designated an economically significant regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, the rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, and the remainder of this section summarizes the key findings of the analysis with respect to costs and benefits of the rule and then presents several possible alternatives to the rule., 191995=30. OSHA's Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) has historically advised the Agency to take into consideration the unique nature of construction work environments by either setting separate standards or making accommodations for the differences in work environments in construction as compared to general industry. ASTM, for example, has separate silica standards of practice for general industry and construction, E 1132-06 and E 2625-09, respectively. To account for differences in the workplace environments for these different sectors, OSHA has proposed separate standards for general industry/maritime and construction. Is this approach necessary and appropriate? What other approaches, if any, should the Agency consider? Provide a rationale for your response., 239916=In 1994, OSHA launched a process to determine which safety and health hazards in the U.S. needed most attention. A priority planning committee included safety and health experts from OSHA, NIOSH, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The committee reviewed available information on occupational deaths, injuries, and illnesses and held an extensive dialogue with representatives of labor, industry, professional and academic organizations, the States, voluntary standards organizations, and the public. The National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health and the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health also made recommendations. Rulemaking for crystalline silica exposure was one of the priorities designated by this process. OSHA indicated that crystalline silica would be added to the Agency's regulatory agenda as other standards were completed and resources became available., 494710=Although most workers with early-stage silicosis (ILO categories 0/1 or 1/0) typically do not experience respiratory symptoms, the primary risk to the affected worker is progression of disease with progressive decline of lung function. Several studies of workers exposed to crystalline silica have shown that, once silicosis is detected by x-ray, a substantial proportion of affected workers can progress beyond ILO category 1 silicosis, even after exposure has ceased (for example, Hughes et al., 1982; Hessel et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1998; Ng et al., 1987a; Yang et al., 2006). In a population of coal miners whose last chest x-ray while employed was classified as major category 0, and who were examined again 10 years after the mine had closed, 20 percent had developed opacities consistent with a classification of at least 1/0, and 4 percent progressed further to at least 2/1 (Miller et al., 1998). Although there were periods of extremely high exposure to respirable quartz in the mine (greater than 2 mg/m3in some jobs between 1972 and 1976, and more than 10 percent of exposures between 1969 and 1977 were greater than 1 mg/m3), the mean cumulative exposure for the cohort over the period 1964-1978 was 1.8 mg/m3-years, corresponding to an average silica concentration of 0.12 mg/m3. In a population of granite quarry workers exposed to an average respirable silica concentration of 0.48 mg/m3(mean length of employment was 23.4 years), 45 percent of those diagnosed with simple silicosis showed radiological progression of disease after 2 to 10 years of follow up (Ng et al., 1987a). Among a population of gold miners, 92 percent progressed in 14 years; exposures of high-, medium-, and low-exposure groups were 0.97, 0.45, and 0.24 mg/m3, respectively (Hessel et al., 1988). Chinese mine and factory workers categorized under the Chinese system of x-ray classification as Ã¢Â€ÂœsuspectedÃ¢Â€? silicosis cases (analogous to ILO 0/1) had a progression rate to stage I (analogous to ILO major category 1) of 48.7 percent and the average interval was about 5.1 years (Yang et al., 2006). These and other studies discussed in the Health Effects section are of populations of workers exposed to average concentrations of respirable crystalline silica above those permitted by OSHA's current general industry PEL. The studies, however, are of interest to OSHA because the Agency's current enforcement data indicate that exposures in this range are still common in some industry sectors. Furthermore, the Agency's preliminary risk assessment is based on use of an exposure metric that is less influenced by exposure pattern and, instead, characterizes the accumulated exposure of workers over time. Further, the use of a cumulative exposure metric reflects the progression of silica-related diseases: While it is not known that silicosis is a precursor to lung cancer, continued exposure to respirable crystalline silica among workers with silicosis has been shown to be associated with malignant respiratory disease (Chen et al., 1992). The Chinese pottery workers study offers an example of silicosis-associated lung cancer among workers in the clay industry, reflecting the variety of health outcomes associated with diverse silica exposures across industrial settings., 107989=Fax: If your submissions, including attachments, are not longer than 10 pages, you may fax them to the OSHA Docket Office at (202) 693-1648., 283165=Data on silicosis mortality and morbidity are likely to understate the true impact of exposure of U.S. workers to crystalline silica. This is in part due to underreporting that is characteristic of passive case-based disease surveillance systems that rely on the health care community to generate records (Froines et al., 1989). Health care professionals play the main role in such surveillance by virtue of their unique role in recognizing and diagnosing diseases, but most health care professionals do not take occupational histories (Goldman and Peters, 1981; Rutstein et al., 1983). In addition to the lack of information about exposure histories, difficulty in recognizing occupational illnesses that have long latency periods, like silicosis, contributes to under-recognition and underreporting by health care providers. Based on an analysis of data from Michigan's silicosis surveillance activities, Rosenman et al. (2003) estimated that the true incidence of silicosis mortality and morbidity were understated by a factor of between 2.5 and 5, and that there were estimated to be from 3,600 to 7,300 new cases of silicosis occurring in the U.S. annually between 1987 and 1996. Taken with the surveillance data presented above, OSHA believes that exposure to crystalline silica remains a cause of significant mortality and morbidity in the U.S., 264478=This section presents a summary of OSHA's review of the health effects literature for respirable crystalline silica. OSHA's full analysis is contained in Section I of the background document entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœRespirable Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€Â”Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment,Ã¢Â€? which has been placed in rulemaking docket OSHA-2010-0034. OSHA's review of the literature on the adverse effects associated with exposure to crystalline silica covers the following topics:, 353144=OSHA has reviewed numerous studies on the relationship of silica exposure to pulmonary function impairment as measured by spirometry. There were several longitudinal studies available. Two groups of researchers conducted longitudinal studies of lung function impairment in Vermont granite workers and reached opposite conclusions. Graham et al (1981, 1994) examined stone shed workers, who had the highest exposures to respirable crystalline silica (between 50 and 100 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3), along with quarry workers (presumed to have lower exposure) and office workers (expected to have negligible exposure). The longitudinal losses of FVC and FEV 1 were not correlated with years employed, did not differ among shed, quarry, and office workers, and were similar, according to the authors, to other blue collar workers not exposed to occupational dust., 106632=Hearing testimony and documentary evidence. Interested persons who request more than 10 minutes to present testimony, or who intend to submit documentary evidence, at the hearings must submit (transmit, send, postmark, deliver) the full text of their testimony and all documentary evidence by December 11, 2013. See Section XV below for details on the format and how to file a notice of intention to appear, submit documentary evidence at the hearing, and request an appropriate amount of time to present testimony., 742397=United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CIC v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1980)., 107449=Written comments. You may submit comments, identified by Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034, by any of the following methods:, 752137=For the OSHA XRD Method ID-142 (revised December 1996), precision is Ã‚Â±23 percent at a working range of 50 to 160 Ã‚Âµg crystalline silica, and the SAE (sampling and analytical error) is Ã‚Â±19 percent. The NIOSH and MSHA XRD and IR methods report a similar degree of precision. OSHA's Salt Lake Technical Center (SLTC) evaluated the precision of ID-142 at lower filter loadings and has shown an acceptable level of precision is achieved at filter loadings of approximately 40 Ã‚Âµg and 20 Ã‚Âµg corresponding to the amounts collected from full-shift sampling at the proposed PEL and action level, respectively. This analysis showed that at filter loadings corresponding to the proposed PEL, the precision and SAE for quartz are Ã‚Â±17 and Ã‚Â±14 percent, respectively. For cristobalite, the precision and SAE are Ã‚Â±19 and Ã‚Â±16 percent, respectively. These results indicate that employers can have confidence in sampling results for the purpose of assessing compliance with the PEL and identifying when additional engineering and work practice controls and/or respiratory protection are needed., 318374=Four studies of gold miners were conducted in South Africa. Two case control studies (Hessel et al., 1986, 1990) reported no significant association between silica exposure and lung cancer, but these two studies may have underestimated risk, according to Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer (1991). Two cohort studies (Reid and Sluis-Cremer, 1996; Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1991) and their associated nested case-control studies found elevated SMRs and odds ratios, respectively, for lung cancer. Reid and Sluis-Cremer (1996) attributed the increased mortality due to lung cancer and other non-malignant respiratory diseases to cohort members' lifestyle choices (particularly smoking and alcohol consumption). However, OSHA notes that the study reported finding a positive, though not statistically significant, association between cumulative crystalline silica exposure and lung cancer, as well as statistically significant association with renal failure, COPD, and other respiratory diseases that have been implicated with silica exposure., 258587=Cristobalite is a form of crystalline silica that is formed at high temperatures (>1470 Ã‚Â°C). Although naturally occurring cristobalite is relatively rare, volcanic eruptions, such as Mount St. Helens, can release cristobalite dust into the air. Cristobalite can also be created during some processes conducted in the workplace. For example, flux-calcined diatomaceous earth is a material used as a filtering aid and as a filler in other products (IARC, 1997). It is produced when diatomaceous earth (diatomite), a geological product of decayed unicellular organisms called diatoms, is heated with flux. The finished product can contain between 40 and 60 percent cristobalite. Also, high temperature furnaces are often lined with bricks that contain quartz. When subjected to prolonged high temperatures, this quartz can convert to cristobalite., 192831=31. OSHA has proposed that the scope of the construction standard include all occupational exposures to respirable crystalline silica in construction work as defined in 29 CFR 1910.12(b) and covered under 29 CFR part 1926, rather than restricting the application of the rule to specific construction operations. Should OSHA modify the scope to limit what is covered? What should be included and what should be excluded? Provide a rationale for your position. Submit your proposed language for the scope and application provision., 232726=OSHA's current standards for workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica were adopted in 1971, pursuant to section 6(a) of the OSH Act (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971). Section 6(a) provided that in the first two years after the effective date of the Act, OSHA had to promulgate Ã¢Â€Âœstart-upÃ¢Â€? standards, on an expedited basis and without public hearing or comment, based on national consensus or established Federal standards that improved employee safety or health. Pursuant to that authority, OSHA in 1971 promulgated approximately 425 permissible exposure limits (PELs) for air contaminants, including silica, derived principally from Federal standards applicable to government contractors under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, 41 U.S.C. 35, and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (commonly known as the Construction Safety Act), 40 U.S.C. 333. The Walsh-Healey Act and Construction Safety Act standards, in turn, had been adopted primarily from recommendations of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)., 301050=Based on its review, OSHA preliminarily concludes that the human data summarized in this section provides ample evidence that exposure to respirable crystalline silica increases the risk of lung cancer among workers. The strongest evidence comes from the worldwide cohort and case-control studies reporting excess lung cancer mortality among workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica dust as quartz in various industrial sectors, including the granite/stone quarrying and processing, industrial sand, mining, and pottery and ceramic industries, as well as to cristobalite in diatomaceous earth and refractory brick industries. The 10-cohort pooled case-control analysis by Steenland et al. (2001a) confirms these findings. A more recent clinic-based pooled case-control analysis of seven European countries by Cassidy et al. (2007) as well as two national death certificate registry studies (Pukkala et al., 2005 in Finland; Calvert et al., 2003 in the United States) support the findings from the cohort and case-control analysis., 236859=As information developed during the 1980s and 1990s, national and international classification organizations came to recognize crystalline silica as a human carcinogen. In June 1986, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluated the available evidence regarding crystalline silica carcinogenicity and concluded that it was Ã¢Â€Âœprobably carcinogenic to humansÃ¢Â€? (IARC, 1987). An IARC working group met again in October 1996 to evaluate the complete body of research, including research that had been conducted since the initial 1986 evaluation. IARC concluded that Ã¢Â€Âœcrystalline silica inhaled in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humansÃ¢Â€? (IARC, 1997)., 203608=52. In OSHA's cadmium standard (29 CFR 1910.1027(f)(1)(ii),(iii), and (iv)), the Agency established separate engineering control air limits (SECALs) for certain processes in selected industries. SECALs were established where compliance with the PEL by means of engineering and work practice controls was infeasible. For these industries, a SECAL was established at the lowest feasible level that could be achieved by engineering and work practice controls. The PEL was set at a lower level, and could be achieved by any allowable combination of controls, including respiratory protection. In OSHA's chromium (VI) standard (29 CFR 1910.1026), an exception similar to SECALs was made for painting airplanes and airplane parts. Should OSHA follow this approach for respirable crystalline silica in any industries or processes? If so, in what industries or processes, and at what exposure levels, should the SECALs be established? Provide the basis for your position and include supporting information., 115526=For general information and press inquiries, contact Frank Meilinger, Director, Office of Communications, Room N-3647, OSHA, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone (202) 693-1999.

Quantitative risk assessments for lung cancer and silicosis mortality were published after the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined more than a decade ago that there was sufficient evidence to regard crystalline silica as a human carcinogen (IARC, 1997). This finding was based on several studies of worker cohorts demonstrating associations between exposure to crystalline silica and an increased risk of lung cancer. Although IARC judged the overall evidence as being sufficient to support this conclusion, IARC also noted that some studies of crystalline silica-exposed workers did not demonstrate an excess risk of lung cancer and that exposure-response trends were not always consistent among studies that were able to describe such trends. These findings led Steenland et al. (2001a) and Mannetje et al. (2002b) to conduct comprehensive exposure-response analyses of the risk of lung cancer and silicosis mortality associated with exposure to crystalline silica. These studies, referred to as the IARC multi-center studies of lung cancer and silicosis mortality, relied on all available cohort data from previously published epidemiological studies for which there were adequate quantitative data on worker exposures to crystalline silica to derive pooled estimates of disease risk. In addition, OSHA identified four single-cohort studies of lung cancer mortality that it judged suitable for quantitative risk assessment; two of these cohorts (Attfield and Costello, 2004; Rice et al., 2001) were included among the 10 used in the IARC multi-center study and studies of two other cohorts appeared later (Hughes et al., 2001; McDonald et al., 2001, 2005; Miller and MacCalman, 2009). For non-malignant respiratory disease mortality, in addition to the silicosis mortality study by Mannetje et al. (2002b), Park et al. (2002) conducted an exposure-response analysis of non-malignant respiratory disease mortality (including silicosis and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) among diatomaceous earth workers. Exposure-response analyses for silicosis morbidity have been published in several single-cohort studies (Chen et al., 2005; Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1993; Steenland and Brown, 1995b; Miller et al., 1998; Buchanan et al., 2003). Finally, a quantitative assessment of end-stage renal disease mortality based on data from three worker cohorts was developed by Steenland et al. (2002a)., 439735=Three thousand three hundred thirty South Dakota gold miners who had worked at least a year underground between 1940 and 1965 were studied by Steenland and Brown (1995b). Workers were followed though 1990 with 1,551 having died; loss to follow up was low (2 percent). Chest x-rays taken in cross-sectional surveys in 1960 and 1976 and death certificates were used to ascertain cases of silicosis. One hundred twenty eight cases were found via death certificate, 29 by x-ray (defined as ILO 1/1 or greater), and 13 by both. Nine percent of deaths had silicosis mentioned on the death certificate. Inclusion of death certificate diagnoses probably increases the risk estimates from this study compared to those that rely exclusively on radiographic findings to evaluate silicosis morbidity risk (see discussion of Hnizdo et al. (1993) above)., 321784=In addition, a recent analysis of 4.8 million death certificates from 27 states within the U.S. for the years 1982 to 1995 showed statistically significant excesses in lung cancer mortality, silicosis mortality, tuberculosis, and NMRD among persons with occupations involving medium and high exposure to respirable crystalline silica (Calvert et al., 2003). A national records and death certificate study was also conducted in Finland by Pukkala et al. (2005), who found a statistically significant excess of lung cancer incidence among men and women with estimated medium and heavy exposures. OSHA believes that these large national death certificate studies and the pooled European community-based case-control study are strongly supportive of the previously reviewed epidemiologic data and supports the conclusion that occupational exposure to crystalline silica is a risk factor for lung cancer mortality., 325160=Studies by Hnizdo et al. (1997), McLaughlin et al. (1992), Hughes et al. (2001), McDonald et al. (2001, 2005), Miller and MacCalman (2009), and Cassidy et al. (2007) had detailed smoking histories with sufficiently large populations and a sufficient number of years of follow-up time to quantify the interaction between crystalline silica exposure and cigarette smoking. In a cohort of white South African gold miners (Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1991) and in the follow-up nested case-control study (Hnizdo et al., 1997) found that the combined effect of exposure to respirable crystalline silica and smoking was greater than additive, suggesting a multiplicative effect. This synergy appeared to be greatest for miners with greater than 35 pack-years of smoking and higher cumulative exposure to silica. In the Chinese nested case-control studies reported by McLaughlin et al. (1992), cigarette smoking was associated with lung cancer, but control for smoking did not influence the association between silica and lung cancer in the mining and pottery cohorts studied. The studies of industrial sand workers by Hughes et al. (2001) and British coal workers by Miller and MacCalman (2009) found positive exposure-response trends after adjusting for smoking histories, as did Cassidy et al. (2007) in their community-based case-control study of exposed European workers., 870708=The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has long held that OSHA standards are economically feasible so long as their costs do not threaten the existence of, or cause massive economic dislocations within, a particular industry or alter the competitive structure of that industry. American Iron and Steel Institute. v. OSHA, 939 F.2d 975, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1991); United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Industrial Union Department v. Hodgson, 499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)., 434652=Chest radiography is not the most sensitive tool used to diagnose or detect silicosis. In 1993, Hnizdo et al. reported the results of a study that compared autopsy and radiological findings of silicosis in a cohort of 557 white South African gold miners. The average period from last x-ray to autopsy was 2.7 years. Silicosis was not diagnosed radiographically for over 60 percent of the miners for whom pathological examination of lung tissue showed slight to marked silicosis. The likelihood of false negatives (negative by x-ray, but silicosis is actually present) increased with years of mining and average dust exposure of the miners. The low sensitivity seen for radiographic evaluation suggests that risk estimates derived from radiographic evidence likely understate the true risk of developing fibrotic lesions as a result of exposure to crystalline silica., 852503=As shown in Table V-10 in the PEA, the estimated unit cost of the initial health screening for current employees in general industry and maritime ranges from approximately $378 to $397 and includes direct medical costs, the opportunity cost of worker time (i.e., lost work time, evaluated at the worker's 2009 hourly wage, including fringe benefits) for offsite travel and for the initial health screening itself, and recordkeeping costs. The variation in the unit cost of the initial health screening is due entirely to differences in the percentage of workers expected to travel offsite for the health screening. In OSHA's experience, the larger the establishment the more likely it is that the selected PLHCP would provide the health screening services at the establishment's worksite. OSHA estimates that 20 percent of establishments with fewer than 20 employees, 75 percent of establishments with 20-499 employees, and 100 percent of establishments with 500 or more employees would have the initial health screening for current employees conducted onsite., 845723=ERG (2013) used respirator cost information from a 2003 OSHA respirator study to estimate the annual cost of $570 (in 2009 dollars) for a half-mask, non-powered, air-purifying respirator and $638 per year (in 2009 dollars) for a full-face non-powered air-purifying respirator (ERG, 2003). These unit costs reflect the annualized cost of respirator use, including accessories (e.g., filters), training, fit testing, and cleaning., 562990=The Supreme Court's benzene decision of 1980, discussed above in this section, states that Ã¢Â€Âœbefore he can promulgate any permanent health or safety standard, the Secretary [of Labor] is required to make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafeÃ¢Â€Â”in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices.Ã¢Â€? Benzene, 448 U.S. at 642. While making it clear that it is up to the Agency to determine what constitutes a significant risk, the Court offered general guidance on the level of risk OSHA might determine to be significant., 613230=OSHA has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) in accordance with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended in 1996. Among the contents of the IRFA are an analysis of the potential impact of the proposed rule on small entities and a description and discussion of significant alternatives to the proposed rule that OSHA has considered. The IRFA is presented in its entirety both in Chapter IX of the PEA and in Section VIII.I of this preamble., 235416=In 1974, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) evaluated crystalline silica as a workplace hazard and issued criteria for a recommended standard on occupational exposure to crystalline silica (NIOSH, 1974). NIOSH recommended that occupational exposure to crystalline silica be controlled so that no worker is exposed to a time-weighted average (TWA) of free (respirable crystalline) silica greater than 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3as determined by a full-shift sample for up to a 10-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The document also recommended a number of ancillary provisions for a standard, such as exposure monitoring and medical surveillance., 432168=OSHA's estimates of renal disease mortality appear in Table VI-2. Based on the life table analysis, OSHA estimates that exposure to the current (0.10 mg/m3) and proposed general industry PEL (0.0.05 mg/m3) over a working life would result in a lifetime excess renal disease risk of 39 (95% CI 2-200) and 32 (95% CI 1.7-147) deaths per 1,000, respectively. For exposure to the current construction/shipyard PEL, OSHA estimates the excess lifetime risk to range from 52 (95% CI 2.2-289) to 63 (95% CI 2.5-368) deaths per 1,000 workers., 234182=For general industry (see 29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-3), the PEL for crystalline silica in the form of respirable quartz is based on two alternative formulas: (1) A particle-count formula, PEL mppcf= 250/(% quartz + 5); and (2) a mass formula proposed by ACGIH in 1968, PEL = (10 mg/m3)/(% quartz + 2). The general industry PELs for cristobalite and tridymite are one-half of the value calculated from either of the above two formulas. For construction (29 CFR 1926.55, Appendix A) and shipyards (29 CFR 1915.1000, Table Z), the formula for the PEL for crystalline silica in the form of quartz (PEL mppcf= 250/(% quartz + 5)), which requires particle counting, is derived from the 1970 ACGIH threshold limit value (TLV).2 The formula based on particle-counting technology used in the general industry, construction, and shipyard PELs is now considered obsolete., 859597=OSHA estimated separate costs for initial training of current employees and for training new hires. Given that new-hire training might need to be performed frequently during the year, OSHA estimated a smaller class size for new hires. OSHA anticipates that training, in accordance with the requirements of the proposed rule, will be conducted by in-house safety or supervisory staff with the use of training modules or videos and will last, on average, one hour. ERG (2007b) judged that establishments could purchase sufficient training materials at an average cost of $2 per worker, encompassing the cost of handouts, video presentations, and training manuals and exercises. ERG (2013) included in the cost estimates for training the value of worker and trainer time as measured by 2009 hourly wage rates (to include fringe benefits). ERG also developed estimates of average class sizes as a function of establishment size. For initial training, ERG estimated an average class size of 5 workers for establishments with fewer than 20 employees, 10 workers for establishments with 20 to 499 employees, and 20 workers for establishments with 500 or more employees. For new hire training, ERG estimated an average class size of 2 workers for establishments with fewer than 20 employees, 5 workers for establishments with 20 to 499 employees, and 10 workers for establishments with 500 or more employees., 111277=Notice of intention to appear, hearing testimony and documentary evidence.

Written comments, including comments on the information collection determination described in Section IX of the preamble (OMB Review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995), must be submitted (postmarked, sent, or received) by December 11, 2013., 354064=Eisen et al. (1983, 1995) found the opposite. They looked at lung function in two groups of granite workers: Ã¢Â€ÂœsurvivorsÃ¢Â€?, who participated in each of five annual physical exams, and Ã¢Â€ÂœdropoutsÃ¢Â€?, who did not participate in the final exam. There was a significant exposure-response relationship between exposure to crystalline silica and FEV 1 decline among the dropouts but not among the survivors. The dropout group had a steeper FEV 1 loss, and this was true for each smoking category. The authors concluded that exposures of about 50 ug/m3produced a measurable effect on pulmonary function in the dropouts. Eisen et al. (1995) felt that the Ã¢Â€Âœhealthy worker effectÃ¢Â€? was apparent in this study and that studies that only looked at Ã¢Â€ÂœsurvivorsÃ¢Â€? would be less likely to see any effect of silica on pulmonary function., 279064=From 1968 to 2002, silicosis was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death on 16,305 death certificates; of these, a total of 15,944 (98 percent) deaths occurred in males (CDC, 2005). From 1968 to 2002, the number of silicosis deaths decreased from 1,157 (8.91 per million persons aged Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 15 years) to 148 (0.66 per million), corresponding to a 93-percent decline in the overall mortality rate. In its most recent WoRLD Report (NIOSH, 2008c), NIOSH reported that the number of silicosis deaths in 2003, 2004, and 2005 were 179, 166, and 161, respectively, slightly higher than that reported in 2002. The number of silicosis deaths identified each year has remained fairly constant since the late 1990's., 885050=The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (codified at 5 U.S.C. 601), requires Federal agencies to consider the economic impact that a proposed rulemaking will have on small entities. The RFA states that whenever a Federal agency is required to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, the agency must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA). 5 U.S.C. 603(a). Pursuant to section 605(b), in lieu of an IRFA, the head of an agency may certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This period covers the first five years of the SEP. These enforcement data, presented in Table 1, indicate that 24 percent of silica samples from the construction industry and 13 percent from general industry were at least three times the OSHA PEL. The data indicate that 66 percent of the silica samples obtained during inspections in general industry were in compliance with the PEL, while only 58 percent of the samples collected in construction were in compliance. As a follow-up to the SEP, OSHA undertook numerous non-regulatory actions to address silica exposures. For example, in October of 1996, OSHA launched a joint silicosis prevention effort with MSHA, NIOSH, and the American Lung Association (DOL, 1996). This public education campaign involved distribution of materials on how to prevent silicosis, including a guide for working safely with silica and stickers for hard hats to remind workers of crystalline silica hazards. Spanish language versions of these materials were also made available. OSHA and MSHA inspectors distributed materials at mines, construction sites, and other affected workplaces. The joint silicosis prevention effort included a National Conference to Eliminate Silicosis in Washington, DC, in March of 1997, which brought together approximately 650 participants from labor, business, government, and the health and safety professions to exchange ideas","8 2 ÃƒÂ— PEL to < 3 ÃƒÂ— PEL 32 4 46 3 Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 3 ÃƒÂ— PEL and higher (3+) 103 14 254 19 Total # of samples 732 1355 Both industry and worker groups have recognized that a comprehensive standard is needed to protect workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica. For example, ASTM (originally known as the American Society for Testing and Materials) has published recommended standards for addressing the hazards of crystalline silica, and the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO also has recommended a comprehensive program standard. These recommended standards include provisions for methods of compliance, exposure monitoring, training, and medical surveillance. The National Industrial Sand Association has also developed exposure assessment, medical surveillance, and training guidance products. In 1997, OSHA announced in its Unified Agenda under Long-Term Actions that it planned to publish a proposed rule on crystalline silica Ã¢Â€Âœbecause the agency has concluded that there will be no significant progress in the prevention of silica-related diseases without the adoption of a full and comprehensive silica standard, including provisions for product substitution, engineering controls, training and education, respiratory protection and medical screening and surveillance. A full standard will improve worker protection, ensure adequate prevention programs, and further reduce silica-related diseases.Ã¢Â€? (62 FR 57755, 57758, Oct. 29, 1997). In November 1998, OSHA moved Ã¢Â€ÂœOccupational Exposure to Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€? to the pre-rule stage in the Regulatory Plan (",True,0,0,"{20353=Draft Recommended Aquatic Life Ambient Water Quality Chronic Criterion for Selenium-Freshwater 2015, 26664=A Proposed Rule by the Food and Drug Administration on 07/27/2015}","{108742=Instructions: All submissions must include the Agency name and the docket number for this rulemaking (Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034). All comments, including any personal information you provide, are placed in the public docket without change and may be made available online at http://www.regulations.gov. Therefore, OSHA cautions you about submitting personal information such as social security numbers and birthdates., 238645=In 1989, OSHA established 8-hour TWA PELs of 0.1 for quartz and 0.05 mg/m3for cristobalite and tridymite, as part of the Air Contaminants final rule for general industry (54 FR 2332, Jan. 19, 1989). OSHA stated that these limits presented no substantial change from the Agency's former formula limits, but would simplify sampling procedures. In providing comments on the proposed rule, NIOSH recommended that crystalline silica be considered a potential carcinogen., 313275=Excess lung cancer mortality was reported in a large cohort study of British coal miners (Miller et al., 2007; Miller and MacCalman, 2009). These studies examined the mortality experience of 17,800 miners through the end of 2005. By that time, the cohort had accumulated 516,431 person years of observation (an average of 29 years per miner), with 10,698 deaths from all causes. Overall lung cancer mortality was elevated (SMR=115.7, 95% C.I. 104.8-127.7), and a positive exposure-response relationship with crystalline silica exposure was determined from Cox regression after adjusting for smoking history. Three of the strengths of this study are the detailed time-exposure measurements of both quartz and total mine dust, detailed individual work histories, and individual smoking histories. For lung cancer, analyses based on the Cox regression provide strong evidence that, for these coal miners, quartz exposures were associated with increased lung cancer risk but that simultaneous exposures to coal dust did not cause increased lung cancer risk. Because of these strengths, OSHA included the quantitative analysis from this study in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (Section II)., 134022=As described in Section XVI of the preamble, Summary and Explanation of the Proposed Standards, OSHA is proposing to require primary reliance on engineering controls and work practices because reliance on these methods is consistent with long-established good industrial hygiene practice, with the Agency's experience in ensuring that workers have a healthy workplace, and with the Agency's traditional adherence to a hierarchy of preferred controls. The Agency's adherence to the hierarchy of controls has been successfully upheld by the courts (see AFL-CIO v. Marshall, 617 F.2d 636 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (cotton dust standard); United Steelworkers v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189 (D.C. Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 453 U.S. 913 (1981) (lead standard); ASARCO v. OSHA, 746 F.2d 483 (9th Cir. 1984) (arsenic standard); Am. Iron & Steel v.

(1983) and included in the Steenland et al. (2001a) pooled analysis, consisting of 5,414 male granite workers who were employed in the Vermont granite industry between 1950 and 1982 and who had received at least one chest x-ray from the surveillance program of the Vermont Department of Industrial Hygiene. Their 2004 report extended follow-up from 1982 to 1994, and found 201 deaths. Workers' cumulative exposures were estimated by Davis et al. (1983) based on historical exposure data collected in six environmental surveys conducted between 1924 and 1977, plus work history information., 117556=IX. OMB Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, 343754=Others have also concluded that there is a relationship between emphysema and exposure to crystalline silica. Green and Vallyathan (1996) reviewed several studies of emphysema in workers exposed to silica. The authors stated that these studies show an association between cumulative dust exposure and death from emphysema. IARC (1997) has also briefly reviewed studies on emphysema in its monograph on crystalline silica carcinogenicity and concluded that exposure to crystalline silica increases the risk of emphysema. In their 2002 Hazard Review, NIOSH concluded that occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica is associated with emphysema but that some epidemiologic studies suggested that this effect may be less frequent or absent in non-smokers., 307261=Costello and Graham (1988) and Graham et al. (2004) in a follow-up study found that Vermont granite workers employed prior to 1930 had an excess risk of lung cancer, but lung cancer mortality among granite workers hired after 1940 (post-implementation of controls) was not elevated in the Costello and Graham (1988) study and was only somewhat elevated (not statistically significant) in the Graham et al. (2004) study. Graham et al. (2004) concluded that their results did not support a causal relationship between granite dust exposure and lung cancer mortality. Looking at the same population, Attfield and Costello (2004) developed a quantitative estimate of cumulative exposure (8 exposure categories) adapted from a job exposure matrix developed by Davis et al. (1983). They found a statistically significant trend with log-transformed cumulative exposure. Lung cancer mortality rose reasonably consistently through the first seven increasing exposure groups, but fell in the highest cumulative exposure group. With the highest exposure group omitted, a strong positive dose-response trend was found for both untransformed and log-transformed cumulative exposures. Attfield and Costello (2004) concluded that exposure to crystalline silica in the range of cumulative exposures typically experienced by contemporarily exposed workers causes an increased risk of lung cancer mortality. The authors explained that the highest exposure group would have included the most unreliable exposure estimates being reconstructed from exposures 20 years prior to study initiation when exposure estimation was less precise. Also, even though the highest exposure group consisted of only 15 percent of the study population, it had a disproportionate effect on dampening the exposure-response relationship., 245926=In an effort to expand the 1996 SEP, on January 24, 2008, OSHA implemented a National Emphasis Program (NEP) to identify and reduce or eliminate the health hazards associated with occupational exposure to crystalline silica (OSHA, 2008). The NEP targeted worksites with elevated exposures to crystalline silica and included new program evaluation procedures designed to ensure that the goals of the NEP were measured as accurately as possible, detailed procedures for conducting inspections, updated information for selecting sites for inspection, development of outreach programs by each Regional and Area Office emphasizing the formation of voluntary partnerships to share information, and guidance on calculating PELs in construction and shipyards. In each OSHA Region, at least two percent of inspections every year are silica-related inspections. Additionally, the silica-related inspections are conducted at a range of facilities reasonably representing the distribution of general industry and construction work sites in that region., 277402=Unlike most occupational diseases, surveillance statistics are available that provide information on the prevalence of silicosis mortality and morbidity in the U.S. The most comprehensive and current source of surveillance data in the U.S. related to occupational lung diseases, including silicosis, is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Work-Related Lung Disease (WoRLD) Surveillance System; the WoRLD Surveillance Report is compiled from the most recent data from the WoRLD System (NIOSH, 2008c). National statistics on mortality associated with occupational lung diseases are also compiled in the National Occupational Respiratory Mortality System (NORMS, available on the Internet at http://webappa.cdc.gov/ords/norms.html), a searchable database administered by NIOSH. In addition, NIOSH published a recent review of mortality statistics in its MMWR Report Silicosis Mortality, Prevention, and ControlÃ¢Â€Â”United States, 1968-2002 (CDC, 2005). For each of these sources, data are compiled from death certificates reported to state vital statistics offices, which are collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Data on silicosis morbidity are available from only a few states that administer occupational disease surveillance systems, and from data on hospital discharges. OSHA believes that the mortality and morbidity statistics compiled in these sources and summarized below indicate that silicosis remains a significant occupational health problem in the U.S. today., 106204=Notice of intention to appear at the hearings. Interested persons who intend to present testimony or question witnesses at the hearings must submit (transmit, send, postmark, deliver) a notice of their intention to do so by November 12, 2013. The notice of intent must indicate if the submitter requests to present testimony in the presence of the peer reviewers., 444790=Buchanan et al., (2003) provided analysis and risk estimates only for silicosis cases defined as having an x-ray classified as ILO 2/1+, after adjusting for the disproportionately severe effect of exposure to high concentrations on silicosis risk. Estimating the risk of acquiring a chest x-ray classified as ILO 1/0+ from the Buchanan (2003) or the earlier Miller et al. (1995, 1998) publications can only be roughly approximated because of the limited summary information included; this information suggests that the risk of silicosis defined as an ILO classification of 1/0+ could be about three times higher than the risk of silicosis defined as an ILO 2/1+ x-ray. OSHA has a high degree of confidence in the estimates of progression to stages 2/1+ from this Scotland coal mine study, mainly because of the highly detailed and extensive exposure measurements, the radiographic records, and the detailed analyses of high exposure-rate effects., 446238=The study incorporated occupational histories, dust measurements and medical examination records. Exposure data consisted of high-flow, short-term gravimetric total dust measurements made routinely since 1950; the authors used data from 1950 to represent earlier exposures since dust control measures were not implemented until 1958. Results from a 1998-1999 survey indicated that respirable silica measurements were 3.6 percent (s.d = 2.5 percent) of total dust measurements. Annual radiographs were taken since 1963 and all cohort members continued to have chest x-rays taken every 2 or 3 years after leaving work. Silicosis was diagnosed when at least 2 of 3 radiologists classified a radiograph as being a Ã¢Â€Âœsuspected caseÃ¢Â€? or at Stage I, II, or III under the 1986 Chinese pneumoconiosis roentgen diagnostic criteria. According to Chen et al. (2001), these four categories under the Chinese system were found to agree closely with ILO categories 0/1, Category 1, Category 2, and Category 3, respectively, based on studies comparing the Chinese and ILO classification systems. Silicosis was observed in 33.7 percent of the group; 67.4 percent of the cases developed after exposure ended., 435564=OSHA's Preliminary QRA examines multiple studies from which silicosis occupational morbidity risks can be estimated. The studies evaluated fall into three major types. Some are cross-sectional studies in which radiographs taken at a point in time were examined to ascertain cases (Kreiss and Zhen, 1996; Love et al., 1999; Ng and Chan, 1994; Rosenman et al., 1996; Churchyard et al., 2003, 2004); these radiographs may have been taken as part of a health survey conducted by the investigators or represent the most recent chest x-ray available for study subjects. Other studies were designed to examine radiographs over time in an effort to determine onset of disease. Some of these studies examined primarily active, or current, workers (Hughes et al., 1998; Muir et al., 1989a, 1989b; Park et al., 2002), while others included both active and retired workers (Chen et al., 2001, 2005; Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1993; Miller et al., 1998; Buchanan et al., 2003; Steenland and Brown, 1995b)., 482564=The Act also requires that the Agency make a finding that the toxic material or harmful physical agent at issue causes material impairment to workers' health. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act directs the Secretary of Labor to Ã¢Â€Âœset the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard . . . for the period of his working life.Ã¢Â€? 29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5). As with significant risk, what constitutes material impairment in any given case is a policy determination for which OSHA is given substantial leeway. Ã¢Â€ÂœOSHA is not required to state with scientific certainty or precision the exact point at which each type of [harm] becomes a material impairment.Ã¢Â€?AFL-CIO v. OSHA, 965 F.2d 962, 975 (11th Cir. 1992). Courts have also noted that OSHA should consider all forms and degrees of material impairmentÃ¢Â€Â”not just death or serious physical harmÃ¢Â€Â”and that OSHA may act with a Ã¢Â€Âœpronounced bias towards worker safety.Ã¢Â€?Id; Bldg & Constr. Trades Dep't v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988)., 247012=A recent analysis of OSHA enforcement data from January 2003 to December 2009 (covering the period of continued implementation of the SEP and the first two years of the NEP) shows that considerable noncompliance with the PEL continues to occur. These enforcement data, presented in Table 2, indicate that 14 percent of silica samples from the construction industry and 19 percent for general industry were at least three times the OSHA PEL during this period. The data indicate that 70 percent of the silica samples obtained during inspections in general industry were in compliance with the PEL, and 75 percent of the samples collected in construction were in compliance., 442859=Silicosis cases were identified as such if the median classification of the three readers indicated an ILO (1980) classification of 1/0 or greater, plus a progression from the earlier reading. Of the 547 men, 203 (38 percent) showed progression of at least one ILO category from the 1970's surveys to the 1990-91 survey; in 128 of these (24 percent) there was progression of two or more steps. In the 1970's survey 504 men had a profusion score of 0; of these, 120 (24 percent) progressed to an ILO classification of 1/0 or greater. Of the 36 men who had shown earlier profusions of 1/0 or greater, 27 (75 percent) showed further progression at the 1990/1991 follow-up. Only one subject showed a regression from any earlier reading, and that was slight, from ILO 1/0 to 0/1., 109308=If you submit scientific or technical studies or other results of scientific research, OSHA requests (but is not requiring) that you also provide the following information where it is available: (1) Identification of the funding source(s) and sponsoring organization(s) of the research; (2) the extent to which the research findings were reviewed by a potentially affected party prior to publication or submission to the docket, and identification of any such parties; and (3) the nature of any financial relationships (e.g., consulting agreements, expert witness support, or research funding) between investigators who conducted the research and any organization(s) or entities having an interest in the rulemaking. If you are submitting comments or testimony on the Agency's scientific and technical analyses, OSHA requests that you disclose: (1) The nature of any financial relationships you may have with any organization(s) or entities having an interest in the rulemaking; and (2) the extent to which your comments or testimony were reviewed by an interested party prior to its submission. Disclosure of such information is intended to promote transparency and scientific integrity of data and technical information submitted to the record. This request is consistent with Executive Order 13563, issued on January 18, 2011, which instructs agencies to ensure the objectivity of any scientific and technological information used to support their regulatory actions. OSHA emphasizes that all material submitted to the rulemaking record will be considered by the Agency to develop the final rule and supporting analyses., 938612=To demonstrate the normal year-to-year variation in profit rates for all the manufacturers in general industry and maritime affected by the proposed rule, OSHA presented data in the PEA on year-to-year profit rates and year-to-year percentage changes in profit rates, by industry, for the years 2000-2006. For the combined affected manufacturing industries in general industry and maritime over the 7-year period, the average change in profit rates was 38.9 percent a year. For the 7 industries in general industry and maritime with the largest estimated potential annual cost impacts as a percentage of profitÃ¢Â€Â”ranging from 4 percent to 9 percentÃ¢Â€Â”the average annual changes in profit rates in these industries over the 7-year period averaged 35 percent., 281471=Silicosis deaths among workers of all ages result in significant premature mortality; between 1996 and 2005, a total of 1,746 deaths resulted in a total of 20,234 years of life lost from life expectancy, with an average of 11.6 years of life lost. For the same period, among 307 decedents who died before age 65, or the end of a working life, there were 3,045 years of life lost to age 65, with an average of 9.9 years of life lost from a working life (NIOSH, 2008c)., 105405=Informal public hearings. The Agency plans to hold informal public hearings beginning on March 4, 2014, in Washington, DC. OSHA expects the hearings to last from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., local time; a schedule will be released prior to the start of the hearings. The exact daily schedule may be amended at the discretion of the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ). If necessary, the hearings will continue at the same time on subsequent days. Peer reviewers of OSHA's Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment will be present in Washington, DC to hear testimony on the second day of the hearing, March 5, 2014; see Section XV for more information on the peer review process., 239167=In 1992, OSHA, as part of the Air Contaminants proposed rule for maritime, construction, and agriculture, proposed the same PELs as for general industry, to make the PELs consistent across all the OSHA-regulated sectors (57 FR 26002, June 12, 1992). However, on July 7 of the same year, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the 1989 Air Contaminants final rule for general industry (Am. Fed'n of Labor and Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. OSHA, 965 F.2d 962 (1992)), which also mooted the proposed rule for maritime, construction, and agriculture. The Court's decision to vacate the rule forced the Agency to return to the PELs adopted in the 1970s., 936942=To demonstrate the normal year-to-year variation in prices for all the manufacturers in general industry and maritime affected by the proposed rule, OSHA developed in the PEA year-to-year producer price indices and year-to-year percentage changes in producer prices, by industry, for the years 1998-2009. For the combined affected manufacturing industries in general industry and maritime over the 12-year period, the average change in producer prices was 3.8 percent a year. For the three industries in general industry and maritime with the largest estimated potential annual cost impact as a percentage of revenue (of approximately 0.35 percent, on average), the average annual changes in producer prices in these industries over the 12-year period averaged 3.5 percent., 113798=Docket: To read or download comments, notices of intention to appear, and materials submitted in response to this Federal Register notice, go to Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034 at http://www.regulations.gov or to the OSHA Docket Office at the address above.

Inforum developed estimates of the employment impacts over the ten-year period from 2014-2023 by feeding OSHA's year-by-year and industry-by-industry estimates of the compliance costs of the proposed rule into its LIFT model. The most important Inforum result is that the proposed silica rule would have a negligibleÃ¢Â€Â”albeit slightly positiveÃ¢Â€Â”net effect on aggregate U.S. employment., 447666=In a later study, Chen et al. (2005) investigated silicosis morbidity risks among three cohorts to determine if the risk varied among workers exposed to silica dust having different characteristics. The cohorts consisted of 4,547 pottery workers, 4,028 tin miners, and 14,427 tungsten miners selected from a total of 20 workplaces. Cohort members included all males employed after January 1, 1950 and who worked for at least one year between 1960 and 1974. Radiological follow-up was through December 31, 1994 and x-rays were scored according to the Chinese classification system as described above by Chen et al. (2001) for the tin miner study. Exposure estimates of cohort members to respirable crystalline silica were based on the same data as described by Chen et al. (2001). In addition, the investigators measured the extent of surface occlusion of crystalline silica particles by alumino-silicate from 47 dust samples taken at 13 worksites using multiple-voltage scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Harrison et al., 2005); this method yielded estimates of the percent of particle surface that is occluded., 418482=Miller et al. (2007) and Miller and MacCalman (2009) continued a follow-up mortality study, begun in 1970, of 18,166 coalminers from 10 British coalmines initially followed through the end of 1992 (Miller et al., 1997). The two recent reports on mortality analyzed the cohort of 17,800 miners and extended the analysis through the end of 2005. By that time there were 516,431 person years of observation, an average of 29 years per miner, with 10,698 deaths from all causes. Causes of deaths of interest included pneumoconiosis, other non-malignant respiratory diseases (NMRD), lung cancer, stomach cancer, and tuberculosis. Three of the strengths of this study are its use of detailed time-exposure measurements of both quartz and total mine dust, detailed individual work histories, and individual smoking histories. However, the authors noted that no additional exposure measurements were included in the updated analysis, since all the mines had closed by the mid 1980's., 251857=OSHA initiated Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) proceedings in 2003, seeking the advice of small business representatives on the proposed rule (68 FR 30583, 30584, May 27, 2003). The SBREFA panel, including representatives from OSHA, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was convened on October 20, 2003. The panel conferred with small entity representatives (SERs) from general industry, maritime, and construction on November 10 and 12, 2003, and delivered its final report, which included comments from the SERs and recommendations to OSHA for the proposed rule, to OSHA's Assistant Secretary on December 19, 2003 (OSHA, 2003)., 112170=Regular mail, express delivery, hand delivery, and messenger and courier service: Submit your materials to the OSHA Docket Office, Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2625, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone (202) 693-2350 (TTY number (877) 889-5627).

McDonald et al., (2001, 2005) found that nephritis/nephrosis mortality was elevated overall among 2,670 industrial sand workers hired 20 or more years prior to follow-up, but there was no apparent relationship with either cumulative or average exposure to crystalline silica. However, Steenland et al. (2001b) did find that increased mortality from acute and chronic renal disease was related to increasing quartiles of cumulative exposure among a larger cohort of 4,626 industrial sand workers. In addition, they also found a positive trend for ESRD case incidence and quartiles of cumulative exposure., 72923=9 actions from December 19th, 2003 to June 2015, 114649=Electronic copies of this Federal Register document are available at http://regulations.gov.

This document, as well as news releases and other relevant information, is also available at OSHA's Web site at http://www.osha.gov., 858899=As specified in paragraph (i) of the proposed rule and 29 CFR 1910.1200, training is required for all employees in jobs where there is potential exposure to respirable crystalline silica. In addition, new hires would require training before starting work. As previously noted, ERG (2013) provided an estimate of the new-hire rate in general industry and maritime, based on the BLS-estimated separations rate of 27.2 percent in manufacturing, and an estimate of the new-hire rate in construction, based on the BLS-estimated separations rate in construction of 64.0 percent., 441735=Miller et al. (1995, 1998) and Buchanan et al. (2003) reported on a 1990/1991 follow-up study of 547 survivors of a 1,416 member cohort of Scottish coal workers from a single mine. These men had all worked in the mine during a period between early 1971 and mid 1976, during which they had experienced Ã¢Â€Âœunusually high concentrations of freshly cut quartz in mixed coalmine dust. The population's exposures to both coal and quartz dust had been measured in unique detail, for a substantial proportion of the men's working lives.Ã¢Â€? Thus, this cohort allowed for the study of the effects of both higher and lower silica concentrations, and exposure-rate effects on the development of silicosis. The 1,416 men had all had previous radiographs dating from before, during, or just after this high concentration period, and the 547 participating survivors received their follow-up chest x-rays between November 1990 and April 1991. Follow-up interviews consisted of questions on current and past smoking habits, and occupational history since leaving the coal mine, which closed in 1981., 237616=In 1991, in the Sixth Annual Report on Carcinogens, the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that respirable crystalline silica was Ã¢Â€Âœreasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogenÃ¢Â€? (NTP, 1991). NTP reevaluated the available evidence and concluded, in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens (NTP, 2000), that Ã¢Â€Âœrespirable crystalline silica (RCS), primarily quartz dust occurring in industrial and occupational settings, is known to be a human carcinogen, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans indicating a causal relationship between exposure to RCS and increased lung cancer rates in workers exposed to crystalline silica dustÃ¢Â€? (NTP, 2000). ACGIH listed respirable crystalline silica (in the form of quartz) as a suspected human carcinogen in 2000, while lowering the TLV to 0.05 mg/m3(ACGIH, 2001). ACGIH subsequently lowered the TLV for crystalline silica to 0.025 mg/m3in 2006, which is the current value (ACGIH, 2010)., 550779=To study non-malignant respiratory diseases, of which silicosis is one, Park et al. (2002) analyzed the California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally studied by Checkoway et al. (1997), consisting of 2,570 diatomaceous earth workers employed for 12 months or more from 1942 to 1994. The authors quantified the relationship between exposure to cristobalite and mortality from chronic lung disease other than cancer (LDOC). Diseases in this category included pneumoconiosis (which included silicosis), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, but excluded pneumonia and other infectious diseases. Less than 25 percent of the LDOC deaths in the analysis were coded as silicosis or other pneumoconiosis (15 of 67). As noted by Park et al. (2002), it is likely that silicosis as a cause of death is often misclassified as emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Exposure-response relationships were explored using both Poisson regression models and Cox's proportional hazards models fit to the same series of relative rate exposure-response models that were evaluated by Rice et al. (2001) for lung cancer (i.e., log-linear, log-square root, log-quadratic, linear relative rate, a power function, and a shape function). Relative or excess rates were modeled using internal controls and adjusting for age, calendar time, ethnicity (Hispanic versus white), and time since first entry into the cohort, or using age- and calendar time-adjusted external standardization to U.S. population mortality rates. There were no LDOC deaths recorded among workers having cumulative exposures above 32 mg/m3-years, causing the response to level off or decline in the highest exposure range; possible explanations considered included survivor selection, depletion of susceptible populations in high dust areas, and/or a higher degree of misclassification of exposures in the earlier years where exposure data were lacking and when exposures were presumably the highest. Therefore, Park et al. (2002) performed exposure-response analyses that restricted the dataset to observations where cumulative exposures were below 10 mg/m3-years, a level more than four times higher than that resulting from 45 years of exposure to the current general industry PEL for cristobalite (which is about 0.05 mg/m3), as well as analyses using the full dataset. Among the models based on the restricted dataset, the best-fitting model with a single exposure term was the linear relative rate model using external adjustment., 139176=. . . within the limits of the best available evidence . . . that the typical firm will be able to develop and install engineering and work practice controls that can meet the PEL in most of its operations. [See United Steelworkers v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1980)], 777198=OSHA estimates that the proposed rule will cost $657.9 million per year in 2009 dollars. Costs originally estimated for earlier years were adjusted to 2009 dollars using the appropriate price indices. All costs are annualized using a discount rate of 7 percent. (A sensitivity analysis using discount rates of 3 percent and 0 percent is presented in the discussion of net benefits.) One-time costs are annualized over 10-year annualization period, and capital goods are annualized over the life of the equipment. OSHA has historically annualized one-time costs over at least a 10-year period, which approximately reflects the average life of a business in the United States. (The Agency has chosen a longer annualization period under special circumstances, such as when a rule involves longer and more complex phase-in periods. In general, a longer annualization period, in such cases, will tend to reduce annualized costs slightly.), 310922=Studies of two overlapping cohorts in the industrial sand industry (Hughes et al., 2001; McDonald et al., 2001, 2005; Rando et al., 2001; Sanderson et al., 2000; Steenland and Sanderson, 2001) reported comparable results. These studies found a statistically significantly increased risk of lung cancer mortality with increased cumulative exposure in both categorical and continuous analyses. McDonald et al. (2001) examined a cohort that entered the workforce, on average, a decade earlier than the cohorts that Steenland and Sanderson (2001) examined. The McDonald cohort, drawn from eight plants, had more years of exposure in the industry (19 versus 8.8 years). The Steenland and Sanderson (2001) cohort worked in 16 plants, 7 of which overlapped with the McDonald, et al. (2001) cohort. McDonald et al. (2001), Hughes et al. (2001), and Rando et al. (2001) had access to smoking histories, plant records, and exposure measurements that allowed for historical reconstruction and the development of a job exposure matrix. Steenland and Sanderson (2001) had limited access to plant facilities, less detailed historic exposure data, and used MSHA enforcement records for estimates of recent exposure. These studies (Hughes et al., 2001; McDonald et al., 2005; Steenland and Sanderson, 2001) show very similar exposure response patterns of increased lung cancer mortality with increased exposure. OSHA included the quantitative exposure-response analysis from the Hughes et al. (2001) study in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (Section II)., 575275=Because there is little available information on the incidence of occupational cancer across all industries, risk from crystalline silica exposure cannot be compared with overall risk from other workplace carcinogens. However, OSHA's previous risk assessments provide estimates of risk from exposure to certain carcinogens. These risk assessments, as with the current assessment for crystalline silica, were based on animal or human data of reasonable or high quality and used the best information then available. Table VII-4 shows the Agency's best estimates of cancer risk from 45 years of occupational exposure to several carcinogens, as published in the preambles to final rules promulgated since the benzene decision in 1980. These risks were judged by the Agency to be significant., 241614=As a follow-up to the SEP, OSHA undertook numerous non-regulatory actions to address silica exposures. For example, in October of 1996, OSHA launched a joint silicosis prevention effort with MSHA, NIOSH, and the American Lung Association (DOL, 1996). This public education campaign involved distribution of materials on how to prevent silicosis, including a guide for working safely with silica and stickers for hard hats to remind workers of crystalline silica hazards. Spanish language versions of these materials were also made available. OSHA and MSHA inspectors distributed materials at mines, construction sites, and other affected workplaces. The joint silicosis prevention effort included a National Conference to Eliminate Silicosis in Washington, DC, in March of 1997, which brought together approximately 650 participants from labor, business, government, and the health and safety professions to exchange ideas and share solutions to reach the goal of eliminating silicosis. The conference highlighted the best methods of eliminating silicosis and included problem-solving workshops on how to prevent the disease in specific industries and job operations; plenary sessions with senior government, labor, and corporate officials; and opportunities to meet with safety and health professionals who had implemented successful silicosis prevention programs., 250593=In 1997, OSHA announced in its Unified Agenda under Long-Term Actions that it planned to publish a proposed rule on crystalline silica Ã¢Â€Âœbecause the agency has concluded that there will be no significant progress in the prevention of silica-related diseases without the adoption of a full and comprehensive silica standard, including provisions for product substitution, engineering controls, training and education, respiratory protection and medical screening and surveillance. A full standard will improve worker protection, ensure adequate prevention programs, and further reduce silica-related diseases.Ã¢Â€? (62 FR 57755, 57758, Oct. 29, 1997). In November 1998, OSHA moved Ã¢Â€ÂœOccupational Exposure to Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€? to the pre-rule stage in the Regulatory Plan (63 FR 61284, 61303-304, Nov. 9, 1998). OSHA held a series of stakeholder meetings in 1999 and 2000 to get input on the rulemaking. Stakeholder meetings for all industry sectors were held in Washington, Chicago, and San Francisco. A separate stakeholder meeting for the construction sector was held in Atlanta., 518267=OSHA also evaluated several longitudinal studies where exposed workers were examined over a period of time to track changes in pulmonary function. Among both active and retired Vermont granite workers exposed to an average of 60 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3, Graham did not find exposure-related decrements in pulmonary function (Graham et al., 1981, 1994). However, Eisen et al. (1995) did find significant pulmonary decrements among a subset of granite workers (termed Ã¢Â€ÂœdropoutsÃ¢Â€?) who left work and consequently did not voluntarily participate in the last of a series of annual pulmonary function tests. This group of workers experienced steeper declines in FEV 1 compared to the subset of workers who remained at work and participated in all tests (termed Ã¢Â€ÂœsurvivorsÃ¢Â€?), and these declines were significantly related to dust exposure. Thus, in this study, workers who had left work had exposure-related declines in pulmonary function to a greater extent than did workers who remained on the job, clearly demonstrating a survivor effect among the active workers. Exposure-related changes in lung function were also reported in a 12-year study of granite workers (Malmberg et al., 1993), in two 5-year studies of South African miners (Hnizdo, 1992; Cowie, 1998), and in a study of foundry workers whose lung function was assessed between 1978 and 1992 (Hertzberg et al., 2002)., 571429=Fatal injury rates for most U.S. industries and occupations may be obtained from data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Table VII-3 shows annual fatality rates per 1,000 employees for several industries for 2007, as well as projected fatalities per 1,000 employees assuming exposure to workplace hazards for 45 years based on these annual rates (BLS, 2010). While it is difficult to meaningfully compare aggregate industry fatality rates to the risks estimated in the quantitative risk assessment for crystalline silica, which address one specific hazard (inhalation exposure to respirable crystalline silica) and several health outcomes (lung cancer, silicosis, NMRD, renal disease mortality), these rates provide a useful frame of reference for considering risk from inhalation exposure to crystalline silica. For example, OSHA's estimated range of 6-60 excess lung cancer deaths per 1,000 workers from regular occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica in the range of 0.05Ã¢Â€Â”0.1 mg/m3is roughly comparable to, or higher than, the expected risk of fatal injuries over a working life in high-risk occupations such as mining and construction (see Table VII-3). Regular exposures at higher levels, including the current construction and shipyard PELs for respirable crystalline silica, are expected to cause substantially more deaths per 1,000 workers from lung cancer (ranging from 37 to 653 per 1,000) than result from occupational injuries in most private industry. At the proposed PEL of 0.05 mg/m3respirable crystalline silica, the Agency's estimate of excess lung cancer mortality, from 6 to 26 deaths per 1,000 workers, is still 3- to10-fold or more higher than private industry's average fatal injury rate, given the same employment time, and substantially exceeds those rates found in lower-risk industries such as finance and educational and health services., 243025=In 2003, OSHA examined enforcement data for the years between 1997 and 2002 and identified high rates of noncompliance with the OSHA respirable crystalline silica PEL, particularly in construction. This period covers the first five years of the SEP. These enforcement data, presented in Table 1, indicate that 24 percent of silica samples from the construction industry and 13 percent from general industry were at least three times the OSHA PEL. The data indicate that 66 percent of the silica samples obtained during inspections in general industry were in compliance with the PEL, while only 58 percent of the samples collected in construction were in compliance., 259815=When heated or cooled sufficiently, crystalline silica can transition between the polymorphic forms, with specific transitions occurring at different temperatures. At higher temperatures the linkages between the silica tetrahedrons break and reform, resulting in new crystalline structures. Quartz converts to cristobalite at 1470 Ã‚Â°C, and at 1723 Ã‚Â°C cristobalite loses its crystalline structure and becomes amorphous fused silica. These high temperature transitions reverse themselves at extremely slow rates, with different forms co-existing for a long time after the crystal cools., 368096=Calvert et al. (1997) found an increased incidence of non-systemic ESRD cases among 2,412 South Dakota gold miners exposed to a median crystalline silica concentration of 0.09 mg/m3. In another study of South Dakota gold miners, Steenland and Brown (1995a) reported a positive trend of chronic renal disease mortality risk and cumulative exposure to respirable crystalline silica, but most of the excess deaths were concentrated among workers hired before 1930 when exposures were likely higher than in more recent years., 240885=In August 1996, the Agency initiated enforcement efforts under a Special Emphasis Program (SEP) on crystalline silica. The SEP was intended to reduce worker silica dust exposures that can cause silicosis. It included extensive outreach as well as inspections. Among the outreach materials available were slides presenting information on hazard recognition and crystalline silica control technology, a video on crystalline silica and silicosis, and informational cards for workers explaining crystalline silica, health effects related to exposure, and methods of control. The SEP provided guidance for targeting inspections of worksites with employees at risk of developing silicosis., 864764=Based on ERG (2007b), OSHA derived unit cost estimates for establishing and maintaining regulated areas to comply with these requirements and estimated that one area would be necessary for every eight workers in general industry and maritime exposed above the PEL. Unit costs include planning time (estimated at eight hours of supervisor time annually); material costs for signs and boundary markers (annualized at $63.64 in 2009 dollars); and costs of $500 annually for two disposable respirators per day to be used by authorized persons (other than those who regularly work in the regulated area) who might need to enter the area in the course of their job duties. In addition, for costing purposes, OSHA estimates that, in response to the protective work clothing requirements in regulated areas, ten percent of employees in regulated areas would wear disposable protective clothing daily, estimated at $5.50 per suit, for an annual clothing cost of $1,100 per regulated area. Tables V-16 in the PEA shows the cost assumptions and unit costs applied in OSHA's cost model for regulated areas in general industry and maritime. Overall, OSHA estimates that each regulated area would, on average, cost employers $1,732 annually in general industry and maritime., 833857=Below, OSHA summarizes its methodology for estimating unit and total costs for the major provisions required under the proposed silica standard. For a full presentation of the cost analysis, see Chapter V of the PEA and ERG (2007a, 2007b, 2011, 2013). OSHA invites comment on all aspects of its preliminary cost analysis., 332891=OSHA believes that the current epidemiological literature provides little, if any, support for treating cristobalite as presenting a greater lung cancer risk than comparable exposure to respirable quartz. Furthermore, the weight of the available toxicological literature no longer supports the hypothesis that cristobalite has a higher toxicity than quartz, and quantitative estimates of lung cancer risk do not suggest that cristobalite is more carcinogenic than quartz. (See Section I.F of the background document, Physical Factors that May Influence Toxicity of Crystalline Silica, for a fuller discussion of this issue.) OSHA preliminary concludes that respirable cristobalite and quartz dust have similar potencies for increasing lung cancer risk. Both IARC (1997) and NIOSH (2002) reached similar conclusions., 742928=To demonstrate the limits of feasibility, OSHA's analysis examines the technological feasibility of the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3, as well as the technological feasibility of an alternative PEL of 25 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3. In total, OSHA analyzed technological feasibility in 108 operations in general industry, maritime, and construction industries. This analysis addresses two different aspects of technological feasibility: (1) The extent to which engineering controls can reduce and maintain exposures; and (2) the capability of existing sampling and analytical methods to measure silica exposures. The discussion below summarizes the findings in Chapter IV of the PEA (see Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034)., 424051=The Mannetje et al. (2002b) silicosis analysis was part of the IARC ten cohort pooled study included in the Steenland et al. (2001a) lung cancer mortality analysis above. These studies included 18,634 subjects and 170 silicosis deaths (n = 150 for silicosis, and n = 20 unspecified pneumoconiosis). The silicosis deaths had a median duration of exposure of 28 years, a median cumulative exposure of 7.2 mg/m3-years, and a median average exposure of 0.26 mg/m3, while the respective values of the whole cohort were 10 years, 0.62 mg/m3-years, and 0.07 mg/m3. Rates for silicosis adjusted for age, calendar time, and study were estimated by Poisson regression; rates increased nearly monotonically with deciles of cumulative exposure, from a mortality rate of 5/100,000 person-years in the lowest exposure category (0-0.99 mg/m3-years) to 299/100,000 person-years in the highest category (>28.10 mg/m3-years). Quantitative estimates of exposure to respirable silica (mg/m3) were available for all six cohorts (Mannetje et al. 2002a). Lifetime risk of silicosis mortality was estimated by accumulating mortality rates over time using the formula, 419503=For this cohort mortality study there were analyses using both external (regional age-time and cause specific mortality rates) internal controls. For the analysis from external mortality rates, the all-cause mortality SMR from 1959 through 2005 was 100.9 (95% C.I., 99.0-102.8), based on all 10,698 deaths. However, these death ratios were not uniform over time. For the period from 1990 to 2005, the all-cause SMR was 109.6 (95% C.I., 106.5-112.8), while the ratios for previous periods were less than 100. This pattern of recent increasing SMRs was also seen in the recent cause-specific death rate for lung cancer, SMR=115.7 (95% C.I., 104.8-127.7). For the analysis based on internal rates and using Cox regression methods, the relative risk for lung cancer risk based on a cumulative quartz exposure equivalent to approximately 0.055 mg/m3for 45 years was RR = 1.14 (95% C.I., 1.04 to 1.25). This risk is adjusted for concurrent coal dust exposure and smoking status, and incorporated a 15-year lag in quartz exposures. The analysis showed a strong effect for smoking (independent of quartz exposure) on lung cancer. For lung cancer, OSHA believes that the analyses based on the Cox regression method provides strong evidence that for these coal miners' quartz exposures were associated with increased lung cancer risk, but that simultaneous exposures to coal dust did not cause increased lung cancer risk. To estimate lung cancer risk from this study, OSHA estimated the regression slope for a log-linear relative risk model based on the Miller and MacCalman's (2009) finding of a relative risk of 1.14 for a cumulative exposure of 0.055 mg/m3-years., 147920=OSHA's preliminary risk assessment indicates that significant risk remains at the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3. Where there is continuing significant risk, the decision in the Asbestos case (Bldg. and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1988)) indicated that OSHA should use its legal authority to impose additional requirements on employers to further reduce risk when those requirements will result in a greater than de minimis incremental benefit to workers' health. OSHA's preliminary conclusion is that the requirements triggered by the action level will result in a very real and necessary, but non-quantifiable, further reduction in risk beyond that provided by the PEL alone. OSHA's choice of proposing an action level for exposure monitoring of one-half of the PEL is based on the Agency's successful experience with other standards, including those for inorganic arsenic (29 CFR 1910.1018), ethylene oxide (29 CFR 1910.1047), benzene (29 CFR 1910.1028), and methylene chloride (29 CFR 1910.1052)., 52525=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 22, 2015, 360977=Wyndham et al. (1986) found a significant excess mortality for chronic respiratory diseases in a cohort of white South African gold miners. Although these data did include silicosis mortality, the authors found evidence demonstrating that none of the miners certified on the death certificate as dying from silicosis actually died from that disease. Instead, pneumoconiosis was always an incidental finding in those dying from some other cause, the most common of which was chronic obstructive lung disease. A case-referent analysis found that, although the major risk factor for chronic respiratory disease was smoking, there was a statistically significant additional effect of cumulative dust exposure, with the relative risk estimated to be 2.48 per ten units of 1000 particle years of exposure., 431211=The combined cohort for the pooled analysis (Steenland et al., 2002a) consisted of 13,382 workers with exposure information available for 12,783 (95 percent). Exposure matrices for the three cohorts had been used in previous studies (Steenland and Brown, 1995a; Attfield and Costello, 2001; Steenland et al., 2001b). The mean duration of exposure, the mean cumulative exposure, and the mean concentration of respirable silica for the pooled cohort were 13.6 years, 1.2 mg/m3-years, and 0.07 mg/m3, respectively. SMRs (compared to the U.S. population) for renal disease (acute and chronic glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome, acute and chronic renal failure, renal sclerosis, and nephritis/nephropathy) were statistically significantly elevated using multiple cause data (SMR 1.29, 95% CI 1.10-1.47, 193 deaths) and underlying cause data (SMR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05-1.85, 51 observed deaths)., 253723=In January 2010, OSHA completed a peer review of the draft Health Effects analysis and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment following procedures set forth by OMB in the Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review, published on the OMB Web site on December 16, 2004 (see 70 FR 2664, Jan. 14, 2005). Each peer reviewer submitted a written report to OSHA. The Agency revised its draft documents as appropriate and made the revised documents available to the public as part of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. OSHA also made the written charge to the peer reviewers, the peer reviewers' names, the peer reviewers' reports, and the Agency's response to the peer reviewers' reports publicly available with publication of this proposed rule. OSHA will schedule time during the informal rulemaking hearing for participants to testify on the Health Effects analysis and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment in the presence of peer reviewers and will request the peer reviewers to submit any amended final comments they may wish to add to the record. The Agency will consider amended final comments received from the peer reviewers during development of a final rule and will make them publicly available as part of the silica rulemaking record., 413882=McDonald et al. (2001), Hughes et al. (2001) and McDonald et al. (2005) followed up on a cohort study of North American industrial sand workers that overlapped with the industrial sand cohort (18 plants, 4,626 workers) studied by Steenland and Sanderson (2001) and included in Steenland et al.'s (2001a) pooled cohort analysis. The McDonald et al. (2001) follow-up cohort included 2,670 men employed before 1980 for three years or more in one of nine North American (8 U.S. and 1 Canadian) sand-producing plants, including 1 large associated office complex. Information on cause of death was obtained, from 1960 through 1994, for 99 percent of the deceased workers for a total 1,025 deaths representing 38 percent of the cohort. A nested case-control study and analysis based on 90 lung cancer deaths from this cohort was also conducted by Hughes et al. (2001). A later update through 2000, of both the cohort and nested case-control studies by McDonald et al. (2005), eliminated the Canadian plant, following 2,452 men from the eight U.S. plants. For the lung cancer case-control part of the study the update included 105 lung cancer deaths. Both the initial and updated case control studies used up to two controls per case., 111964=Fax: If your written submission does not exceed 10 pages, including attachments, you may fax it to the OSHA Docket Office at (202) 693-1648., 204812=53. The proposed standards do not contain a requirement for a written exposure control program. The two ASTM standards for general industry and construction (E 1132-06, section 4.2.6, and E 2626-09, section 4.2.5) state that, where overexposures are persistent (such as in regulated areas or abrasive blasting operations), a written exposure control plan shall establish engineering and administrative controls to bring the area into compliance, if feasible. In addition, the proposed regulatory language developed by the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO contains provisions for a written program. The ASTM standards recommend that, where there are regulated areas with persistent exposures or tasks, tools, or operations that tend to cause respirable crystalline silica exposure, the employer will conduct a formal analysis and implement a written control plan (an abatement plan) on how to bring the process into compliance. If that is not feasible, the employer is to indicate the respiratory protection and other protective procedures that will be used to protect employee(s) permanently or until compliance will be achieved. Should OSHA require employers to develop and implement a written exposure control plan and, if so, what should be required to be in the plans?, 492894=Silicosis is the oldest known occupational lung disease and is still today the cause of significant premature mortality. In 2005, there were 161 deaths in the U.S. where silicosis was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death on a death certificate (NIOSH, 2008c). Between 1996 and 2005, deaths attributed to silicosis resulted in an average of 11.6 years of life lost by affected workers (NIOSH, 2007). In addition, exposure to respirable crystalline silica remains an important cause of morbidity and hospitalizations. State-based hospital discharge data show that in the year 2000, 1,128 silicosis-related hospitalizations occurred, indicating that silicosis continues to be a significant health issue in the U.S. (CSTE, 2005). Although there is no national silicosis disease surveillance system in the U.S., a published analysis of state-based surveillance data from the time period 1987-1996 estimated that between 3,600-7,000 new cases of silicosis occurred in the U.S. each year (Rosenman et al., 2003). It has been widely reported that available statistics on silicosis-related mortality and morbidity are likely to be understated due to misclassification of causes of death (for example, as tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or cor pulmonale), errors in recording occupation on death certificates, or misdiagnosis of disease by health care providers (Goodwin, 2003; Windau et al., 1991; Rosenman et al., 2003). Furthermore, reliance on chest x-ray findings may miss cases of silicosis because fibrotic changes in the lung may not be visible on chest radiograph; thus, silicosis may be present absent x-ray signs or may be more severe than indicated by x-ray (Hnizdo et al., 1993; Craighead and Vallyathan, 1980; Rosenman et al., 1997)., 487682=Section I of OSHA's Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (available in Docket OSHA-2010-0034) describes in detail the adverse health conditions that workers who are exposed to respirable crystalline silica are at risk of developing. The Agency's findings are summarized in Section V of this preamble (Health Effects Summary). The adverse health effects discussed include lung cancer, silicosis, other non-malignant respiratory disease (NMRD), and immunological and renal effects., 889428=The annualized costs per affected establishment for each affected industry were calculated by distributing the industry-level (incremental) annualized compliance costs among all affected establishments in the industry, where costs were annualized using a 7 percent discount rate. The annualized cost of the proposed rule for the average establishment in all of general industry and maritime is estimated at $2,571 in 2009 dollars. It is clear from Table VIII-11 that the estimates of the annualized costs per affected establishment in general industry and maritime vary widely from industry to industry. These estimates range from $40,468 for NAICS 327111 (Vitreous china plumbing fixtures and bathroom accessories manufacturing) and $38,422 for NAICS 327121 (Brick and structural clay manufacturing) to $107 for NAICS 325510 (Paint and coating manufacturing) and $49 for NAICS 621210 (Dental offices)., 222023=82. OSHA is providing an abbreviated training section in this proposal as compared to ASTM consensus standards (see ASTM E 1132-06, sections 4.8.1-5). The Hazard Communication standard is comprehensive and covers most of the training requirements traditionally included in an OSHA health standard. Do you concur with OSHA that performance-based training specified in the Hazard Communication standard, supplemented by the few training requirements of this section, is sufficient in its scope and depth? Are there any other training provisions you would add?, 438405=The average respirable dust exposure for the cohort overall was 0.29 mg/m3(range 0.11-0.47), corresponding to an estimated average respirable silica concentration of 0.09 mg/m3(range 0.033-0.14). The average cumulative dust exposure for the overall cohort was 6.6 mg/m3-years (range 1.2-18.7), or an average cumulative silica exposure of 1.98 mg/m3-years (range 0.36-5.61). OSHA believes that the exposure estimates for the cohort are uncertain given the need to rely on particle count data generated over a fairly narrow production period., 433414=The International Labour Organization's (ILO) 1980 International Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses is accepted as the standard against which chest radiographs are measured in epidemiologic studies, for medical surveillance and for clinical evaluation. According to this standard, if radiographic findings are or may be consistent with pneumoconiosis, then the size, shape, and extent of profusion of opacities are characterized by comparing the radiograph to standard films. Classification by shape (rounded vs. irregular) and size involves identifying primary and secondary types of small opacities on the radiograph and classifying them into one of six size/shape categories. The extent of profusion is judged from the concentrations of opacities as compared with that on the standard radiographs and is graded on a 12-point scale of four major categories (0-3, with Category 0 representing absence of opacities), each with three subcategories. Most of the studies reviewed by OSHA considered a finding consistent with an ILO classification of 1/1 to be a positive diagnosis of silicosis, although some also considered an x-ray classification of 1/0 or 0/1 to be positive., 281984=Data on the prevalence of silicosis morbidity are available from only three states (Michigan, Ohio, and New Jersey) that have administered disease surveillance programs over the past several years. These programs rely primarily on hospital discharge records, reporting of cases from the medical community, workers' compensation programs, and death certificate data. For the reporting period 1993-2002, the last year for which data are available, three states (Michigan, New Jersey and Ohio) recorded 879 cases of silicosis (NIOSH 2008c). Hospital discharge records represent the primary ascertainment source for all three states. It should be noted that hospital discharge records most likely include cases of acute silicosis or very advance chronic silicosis since it is unlikely that there would be a need for hospitalization in cases with early radiographic signs of silicosis, such as for an ILO category 1/0 x-ray. Nationwide hospital discharge data compiled by NIOSH (2008c) and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE, 2005) indicates that there are at least 1,000 hospitalizations each year due to silicosis., 53224=On June 2, 2015, the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) hosted its 3rd Annual Federal Register Liaison Conference in the National ArchivesÃ¢Â€Â™ McGowan Theater. What exactly is a Federal... Continue reading Ã¢Â†Â’, 445861=Chen et al. (2001) reported the results of a retrospective study of a Chinese cohort of 3,010 underground miners who had worked in tin mines at least one year between 1960 and 1965. They were followed through 1994, by which time 2,426 (80.6%) workers had either retired or died, and only 400 (13.3%) remained employed at the mines., 335366=In their 2002 hazard review of respirable crystalline silica, NIOSH identified numerous epidemiological studies and reported statistically significant increases in death rates due to gastric or stomach cancer. OSHA preliminarily concurs with observations made previously by Cocco et al. (1996) and the NIOSH (2002) crystalline silica hazard review that the vast majority of epidemiology studies of silica and stomach cancer have not sufficiently adjusted for the effects of confounding factors or have not been sufficiently designed to assess a dose-response relationship (e.g., Finkelstein and Verma, 2005; Moshammer and Neuberger, 2004; Selikoff, 1978, Stern et al., 2001). Other studies did not demonstrate a statistically significant dose-response relationship (e.g., Calvert et al., 2003; Tsuda et al., 2001). Therefore, OSHA believes the evidence is insufficient to conclude that silica is a gastric carcinogen., 112739=Instructions: All submissions must include the Agency name and docket number for this rulemaking (Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034).

Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasized the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. The full PEA has been placed in OSHA rulemaking docket OSHA-2010-0034. This rule is an economically significant regulatory action under Sec. 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866 and has been reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, as required by executive order., 540573=Somewhat higher risk estimates are derived from the analysis presented by Attfield and Costello (2004) of Vermont granite workers. This study involved a cohort of 5,414 male granite workers who were employed in the Vermont granite industry between 1950 and 1982 and who were followed through 1994. Workers' cumulative exposures were estimated by Davis et al. (1983) based on historical exposure data collected in six environmental surveys conducted between 1924 and 1977. A categorical analysis showed an increasing trend of lung cancer risk ratios with increasing exposure, and Poisson regression was used to evaluate several exposure-response models with varying exposure lags and use of either untransformed or log-transformed exposure metrics. The best-fitting model was based on use of a 15-year lag, use of untransformed cumulative exposure, and omission of the highest exposure group. The investigators believed that the omission of the highest exposure group was appropriate since: (1) The underlying exposure data for the high-exposure group was weaker than for the others; (2) there was a greater likelihood that competing causes of death and misdiagnoses of causes of death attenuated the lung cancer death rate in the highest exposure group; (3) all of the remaining groups comprised 85 percent of the deaths in the cohort and showed a strong linear increase in lung cancer mortality with increasing exposure; and (4) the exposure-response relationship seen in the lower exposure groups was more relevant given that the exposures of these groups were within the range of current occupational standards. OSHA's use of the exposure coefficient from this analysis in a log-linear relative risk model yielded a risk estimate of 60 deaths per 1,000 workers for 45 years of exposure to the current general industry PEL of 0.1 mg/m3, 25 deaths per 1,000 for 45 years of exposure to the proposed PEL of 0.05 mg/m3, and 11 deaths per 1,000 for 45 years of exposure at the proposed action level of 0.025 mg/m3. Estimated risks associated with 45 years of exposure at the current construction PEL range from 250 to 653 deaths per 1,000., 337909=In 2002, NIOSH conducted a thorough literature review of the health effects potentially associated with crystalline silica exposure including a review of lung cancer and other carcinogens. NIOSH noted that for workers who may have been exposed to crystalline silica, there have been infrequent reports of statistically significant excesses of deaths for other cancers. A summary of these cancer studies as cited in NIOSH (2002) have been reported in the following organ systems (see NIOSH, 2002 for full bibliographic references): salivary gland; liver; bone; pancreatic; skin; lymphopoetic or hematopoietic; brain; and bladder., 286130=The study reflecting average exposures most similar to current exposure conditions is that of Miller et al. (1998), which followed a group of 547 British coal miners in 1990-1991 to evaluate chest x-ray changes that had occurred after the mines closed in 1981. This study had data available from chest x-rays taken during health surveys conducted between 1954 and 1978, as well as data from extensive exposure monitoring conducted between 1964 and 1978. The mean and maximum cumulative exposure reported in the study correspond to average concentrations of 0.12 and 0.55 mg/m3, respectively, over the 15-year sampling period. However, between 1971 and 1976, workers experienced unusually high concentrations of respirable quartz in one of the two coal seams in which the miners worked. For some occupations, quarterly mean quartz concentrations ranged from 1 to 3 mg/m3, and for a brief period, concentrations exceeded 10 mg/m3for one job. Some of these high exposures likely contributed to the extent of disease progression seen in these workers; in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment, OSHA reviewed a study by Buchanan et al. (2003), who found that short-term exposures to high (>2 mg/m3) concentrations of silica can increase the silicosis risk by 3-fold over what would be predicted by cumulative exposure alone (see Section VI)., 384664=The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act or Act) and some landmark court cases have led OSHA to rely on quantitative risk assessment, to the extent possible, to support the risk determinations required to set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for a toxic substance in standards under the OSH Act. A determining factor in the decision to perform a quantitative risk assessment is the availability of suitable data for such an assessment. In the case of crystalline silica, there has been extensive research on its health effects, and several quantitative risk assessments have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature that describe the risk to exposed workers of lung cancer mortality, silicosis mortality and morbidity, non-malignant respiratory disease mortality, and renal disease mortality. These assessments were based on several studies of occupational cohorts in a variety of industry sectors, the underlying studies of which are described in OSHA's review of the health effects literature (see section V of this preamble). In this section, OSHA summarizes its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) for crystalline silica, which is presented in Section II of the background document entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœRespirable Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€Â”Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk AssessmentÃ¢Â€? (placed in Docket OSHA-2010-0034)., 362817=Park et al. (2002) analyzed the California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally studied by Checkoway et al. (1997), consisting of 2,570 diatomaceous earth workers employed for 12 months or more from 1942 to 1994, to quantify the relationship between exposure to cristobalite and mortality from chronic lung disease other than cancer (LDOC). Diseases in this category included pneumoconiosis (which included silicosis), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, but excluded pneumonia and other infectious diseases. Smoking information was available for about 50 percent of the cohort and for 22 of the 67 LDOC deaths available for analysis, permitting Park et al. (2002) to at least partially adjust for smoking. Using the exposure estimates developed for the cohort by Rice et al. (2001) in their exposure-response study of lung cancer risks, Park et al. (2002) evaluated the quantitative exposure-response relationship for LDOC mortality and found a strong positive relationship with exposure to respirable crystalline silica. OSHA finds this study particularly compelling because of the strengths of the study design and availability of smoking history data on part of the cohort and high-quality exposure and job history data; consequently, OSHA has included this study in its Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment., 108195=Mail, hand delivery, express mail, messenger, or courier service: You must submit your comments to the OSHA Docket Office, Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034, U.S. Department of Labor, Room N-2625, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210, telephone (202) 693-2350 (OSHA's TTY number is (877) 889-5627). Deliveries (hand, express mail, messenger, or courier service) are accepted during the Department of Labor's and Docket Office's normal business hours, 8:15 a.m.-4:45 p.m., E.T., 157498=Both industry and worker groups have recognized that a comprehensive standard is needed to protect workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica. For example, the industry consensus standards for crystalline silica, ASTM E 1132-06, Standard Practice for Health Requirements Relating to Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica, and ASTM E 2626-09, Standard Practice for Controlling Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica for Construction and Demolition Activities, as well as the draft proposed silica standard for construction developed by the Building and Construction Trades Department, AFL-CIO, have each included comprehensive programs. These recommended standards include provisions for methods of compliance, exposure monitoring, training, and medical surveillance (ASTM, 2006; 2009; BCTD 2001). Moreover, as mentioned previously, where there is continuing significant risk, the decision in the Asbestos case (Bldg. and Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock, 838 F.2d 1258, 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1988)) indicated that OSHA should use its legal authority to impose additional requirements on employers to further reduce risk when those requirements will result in a greater than de minimis incremental benefit to workers' health. OSHA preliminarily concludes that the additional requirements in the ancillary provisions of the proposed standard clearly exceed this threshold., 272677=The clinical diagnosis of silicosis has three requisites (Balaan and Banks, 1992; Banks, 2005). The first is the recognition by the physician that exposure to crystalline silica adequate to cause this disease has occurred. The second is the presence of chest radiographic abnormalities consistent with silicosis. The third is the absence of other illnesses that could resemble silicosis on chest radiograph, e.g., pulmonary fungal infection or miliary tuberculosis. To describe the presence and severity of silicosis from chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images, a standardized system exists to classify the opacities seen on chest radiographs (the International Labor Organization (ILO) International Classification of Radiographs of the Pneumoconioses (ILO, 1980, 2002, 2011; Merchant and Schwartz, 1998; NIOSH, 2011). This system standardizes the description of chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images with respect to the size, shape, and density of opacities, which together indicate the severity and extent of lung involvement. The density of opacities seen on chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images is classified on a 4-point major category scale (0, 1, 2, or 3), with each major category divided into three subcategories, giving a 12-point scale between 0/0 and 3/+. (For each subcategory, the top number indicates the major category that the profusion most closely resembles, and the bottom number indicates the major category that was given secondary consideration.) Major category 0 indicates the absence of visible opacities and categories 1 to 3 reflect increasing profusion of opacities and a concomitant increase in severity of disease. Biopsy is not necessary to make a diagnosis and a diagnosis does not require that chest x-ray films or digital radiographic images be rated using the ILO system (NIOSH, 2002). In addition, an assessment of pulmonary function, though not itself necessary to confirm a diagnosis of silicosis, is important to evaluate whether the individual has impaired lung function., 405113=Rice et al. (2001) applied a variety of exposure-response models to the same California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally reported on by Checkoway et al. (1993, 1996, 1997) and included in the pooled analysis conducted by Steenland et al. (2001a) described above. The cohort consisted of 2,342 white males employed for at least one year between 1942 and 1987 in a California diatomaceous earth mining and processing plant. The cohort was followed until 1994, and included 77 lung cancer deaths. Rice et al. (2001) relied on the dust exposure assessment developed by Seixas et al. (1997) from company records of over 6,000 samples collected from 1948 to 1988; cristobalite was the predominate form of crystalline silica to which the cohort was exposed. Analysis was based on both Poisson regression models Cox's proportional hazards models with various functions of cumulative silica exposure in mg/m3-years to estimate the relationship between silica exposure and lung cancer mortality rate. Rice et al. (2001) reported that exposure to crystalline silica was a significant predictor of lung cancer mortality for nearly all of the models employed, with the linear relative risk model providing the best fit to the data in the Poisson regression analysis., 137758=Because respirators are less reliable than engineering and work practice controls and may create additional problems, OSHA believes that primary reliance on respirators to protect workers is generally inappropriate when feasible engineering and work practice controls are available. All OSHA substance-specific health standards have recognized and required employers to observe the hierarchy of controls, favoring engineering and work practice controls over respirators. OSHA's PELs, including the current PELs for respirable crystalline silica, also incorporate this hierarchy of controls. In addition, the industry consensus standards for crystalline silica (ASTM E 1132-06, Standard Practice for Health Requirements Relating to Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica, and ASTM E 2626-09, Standard Practice for Controlling Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica for Construction and Demolition Activities) incorporate the hierarchy of controls., 426194=Park et al. (2002) analyzed the California diatomaceous earth cohort data originally studied by Checkoway et al. (1997), consisting of 2,570 diatomaceous earth workers employed for 12 months or more from 1942 to 1994, to quantify the relationship between exposure to cristobalite and mortality from chronic lung disease other than cancer (LDOC). Diseases in this category included pneumoconiosis (which included silicosis), chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, but excluded pneumonia and other infectious diseases. Industrial hygiene data for the cohort were available from the employer for total dust, silica (mostly cristobalite), and asbestos. Park et al. (2002) used the exposure assessment previously reported by Seixas et al. (1997) and used by Rice et al. (2001) to estimate cumulative crystalline silica exposures for each worker in the cohort based on detailed work history files. The mean silica concentration for the cohort overall was 0.29 mg/m3over the period of employment (Seixas et al., 1997). The mean cumulative exposure values for total respirable dust and respirable crystalline silica were 7.31 and 2.16 mg/m3-year, respectively. Similar cumulative exposure estimates were made for asbestos. Smoking information was available for about 50 percent of the cohort and for 22 of the 67 LDOC deaths available for analysis, permitting Park et al. (2002) to at least partially adjust for smoking. Estimates of LDOC mortality risks were derived via Poisson and Cox's proportional hazards models; a variety of relative rate model forms were fit to the data, with a linear relative rate model being selected for risk estimation., 230604=With respect to economic feasibility, the courts have held that a standard is feasible if it does not threaten massive dislocation to or imperil the existence of the industry. Id. at 1265. A court must examine the cost of compliance with an OSHA standard,, 490380=The diagnosis of silicosis is based on a history of exposure to respirable crystalline silica, chest radiograph findings, and the exclusion of other conditions, including tuberculosis (TB). Because workers affected by early stages of chronic silicosis are often asymptomatic, the finding of opacities in the lung is key to detecting silicosis and characterizing its severity. The International Labour Organization (ILO) International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses (ILO, 1980, 2002, 2011) is the currently accepted standard against which chest radiographs are evaluated in epidemiologic studies, for medical surveillance, and for clinical evaluation. The ILO system standardizes the description of chest x-rays, and is based on a 12-step scale of severity and extent of silicosis as evidenced by the size, shape, and density of opacities seen on the x-ray film. Profusion (frequency) of small opacities is classified on a 4-point major category scale (0-3), with each major category divided into three, giving a 12-point scale between 0/Ã¢ÂˆÂ’ and 3/+. Large opacities are defined as any opacity greater than 1 cm that is present in a film., 539088=Rice et al. (2001) presents an exposure-response analysis of the diatomaceous worker cohort studied by Checkoway et al. (1993, 1996, 1997), who found a significant relationship between exposure to respirable cristobalite and increased lung cancer mortality. The cohort consisted of 2,342 white males employed for at least one year between 1942 and 1987 in a California diatomaceous earth mining and processing plant. The cohort was followed until 1994, and included 77 lung cancer deaths. The risk analysis relied on an extensive job-specific exposure assessment developed by Sexias et al. (1997), which included use of over 6,000 samples taken during the period 1948 through 1988. The mean cumulative exposure for the cohort was 2.16 mg/m3-years for respirable crystalline silica dust. Rice et al. (2001) evaluated several model forms for the exposure-response analysis and found exposure to respirable cristobalite to be a significant predictor of lung cancer mortality with the best-fitting model being a linear relative risk model (with a 15-year exposure lag). From this model, the estimates of the excess risk of lung cancer mortality are 34, 17, and 9 deaths per 1,000 workers for 45-years of exposure to 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mg/m3, respectively. For exposures in the range of the current construction and shipyard PELs over 45 years, estimated risks lie in a range between 81 and 152 deaths per 1,000 workers., 124420=OSHA directed InforumÃ¢Â€Â”a not-for-profit corporation (based at the University of Maryland) well recognized for its macroeconomic modelingÃ¢Â€Â”to run its LIFT (Long-term Interindustry Forecasting Tool) model of the U.S. economy to estimate the industry and aggregate employment effects of the proposed silica rule. Inforum developed estimates of the employment impacts over the ten-year period from 2014-2023 by feeding OSHA's year-by-year and industry-by-industry estimates of the compliance costs of the proposed rule into its LIFT model. Based on the resulting Inforum estimates of employment impacts, OSHA has preliminarily concluded that the proposed rule would have a negligibleÃ¢Â€Â”albeit slightly positiveÃ¢Â€Â”net impact on aggregate U.S. employment., 221133=81. OSHA has proposed that employers provide hazard information to employees in accordance with the Agency's Hazard Communication standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). Compliance with the Hazard Communication standard would mean that there would be a requirement for a warning label for substances that contain more than 0.1 percent crystalline silica. Should this requirement be changed so that warning labels would only be required of substances more than 1 percent by weight of silica? Provide the rationale for your position. The Agency also has proposed additional training specific to work with respirable crystalline silica. Should OSHA include these additional requirements in the final rule, or are the requirements of the Hazard Communication standard sufficient?, 279847=NIOSH cited two main factors that were likely responsible for the declining trend in silicosis mortality since 1968. First, many of the deaths in the early part of the study period occurred among persons whose main exposure to crystalline silica dust probably occurred before introduction of national standards for silica dust exposure established by OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) (i.e., permissible exposure limits (PELs)) that likely led to reduced silica dust exposure. Second, there has been declining employment in heavy industries (e.g., foundries) where silica exposure was prevalent (CDC, 2005). Although the factors described by NIOSH are reasonable explanations for the steep reduction in silicosis-related mortality, it should be emphasized that the surveillance data are insufficient for the analysis of residual risk associated with current occupational exposure limits for crystalline silica. Analyses designed to explore this question must make use of appropriate exposure-response data, as is presented in OSHA's Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment (summarized in Section VI of this preamble)., 281075=Although the number of deaths from silicosis overall has declined since 1968, the number of silicosis-associated deaths reported among persons aged 15 to 44 had not declined substantially prior to 1995 (CDC 1998). Unfortunately, it is not known to what extent these deaths among younger workers were caused by acute or accelerated forms of silicosis., 252647=Throughout the crystalline silica rulemaking process, OSHA has presented information to, and has consulted with, the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) and the Maritime Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health (MACOSH). In December of 2009, OSHA representatives met with ACCSH to discuss the rulemaking and receive their comments and recommendations. On December 11, ACCSH passed motions supporting the concept of Table 1 in the draft proposed construction rule and recognizing that the controls listed in Table 1 are effective. (As discussed with regard to paragraph (f) of the proposed rule, Table 1 presents specified control measures for selected construction operations.) ACCSH also recommended that OSHA maintain the protective clothing provision found in the SBREFA panel draft regulatory text and restore the Ã¢Â€Âœcompetent personÃ¢Â€? requirement and responsibilities to the proposed rule. Additionally, the group recommended that OSHA move forward expeditiously with the rulemaking process., 53164=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 4, 2015, 53832=Posted by Ben Jordi on June 1, 2015, 351730=A review published by NIOSH in 2002 discussed studies related to silica exposure and development of chronic bronchitis. NIOSH concluded, based on the same studies reviewed by OSHA, that occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica is associated with bronchitis, but that some epidemiologic studies suggested that this effect may be less frequent or absent in non-smokers., 236128=In December 1974, OSHA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) based on the recommendations in the NIOSH criteria document (39 FR 44771, Dec. 27, 1974). In the ANPRM, OSHA solicited Ã¢Â€Âœpublic participation on the issues of whether a new standard for crystalline silica should be issued on the basis of the [NIOSH] criteria or any other information, and, if so, what should be the contents of a proposed standard for crystalline silica.Ã¢Â€? OSHA also set forth the particular issues of concern on which comments were requested. The Agency did not pursue a final rule for crystalline silica at that time., 843344=OSHA's cost estimates assume that implementation of the recommended silica controls prevents workers in general industry and maritime from being exposed over the PEL in most cases. Specifically, based on its technological feasibility analysis, OSHA expects that the technical controls are adequate to keep silica exposures at or below the PEL for an alternative PEL of 100 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3(introduced for economic analysis purposes). [17] For the proposed 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3PEL, OSHA's feasibility analysis suggests that the controls that employers use, either because of technical limitations or imperfect implementation, might not be adequate in all cases to ensure that worker exposures in all affected job categories are at or below 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3. For this preliminary cost analysis, OSHA estimates that ten percent of the at-risk workers in general industry would require respirators, at least occasionally, after the implementation of engineering controls to achieve compliance with the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3. For workers in maritime, the only activity with silica exposures above the proposed PEL of 50 ÃŽÂ¼ g/m3is abrasive blasting, and maritime workers engaged in abrasive blasting are already required to use respirators under the existing OSHA ventilation standard (29 CFR 1910.94(a)). Therefore, OSHA has estimated no additional costs for maritime workers to use respirators as a result of the proposed silica rule., 440641=Exposure was estimated by conversion of impinger (particle count) data and was based on measurements indicating an average of 13 percent silica in the dust. Based on these data, the authors estimated the mean exposure concentration to be 0.05 mg/m3for the overall cohort, with those hired before 1930 exposed to an average of 0.15 mg/m3. The average duration of exposure for cases was 20 years (s.d = 8.7) compared to 8.2 years (s.d = 7.9) for the rest of the cohort. This study found that cumulative exposure was the best disease predictor, followed by duration of exposure and average exposure. Lifetime risks were estimated from Poisson regression models using standard life table techniques. The authors estimated a risk of 47 percent associated with 45 years of exposure to 0.09 mg/m3respirable crystalline silica, which reduced to 35 percent after adjustment for age and calendar time., 545010=Miller and MacCalman (2010, also reported in Miller et al., 2007) extended the follow-up of a previously published cohort mortality study (Miller and Buchanan, 1997). The follow-up study included 17,800 miners from 10 coal mines in the U.K. who were followed through the end of 2005; observation in the original study began in 1970. By 2005, there were 516,431 person years of observation, an average of 29 years per miner, with 10,698 deaths from all causes. Exposure estimates of cohort members were not updated from the earlier study since the mines closed in the 1980s; however, some of these men might have had additional exposure at other mines or facilities. An analysis of cause-specific mortality was performed using external controls; it demonstrated that lung cancer mortality was statistically significantly elevated for coal miners exposed to silica. An analysis using internal controls was performed via Cox proportional hazards regression methods, which allowed for each individual miner's measurements of age and smoking status, as well as the individual's detailed dust and quartz time-dependent exposure measurements. From the Cox regression, Miller and MacCalman (2009) estimated that cumulative exposure of 5 g-h/m3respirable quartz (incorporating a 15-year lag) was associated with a relative risk of 1.14 for lung cancer. This cumulative exposure is about equivalent to 45 years of exposure to 0.055 mg/m3respirable quartz, or a cumulative exposure of 2.25 mg/m3-yr, assuming 2,000 hours of exposure per year. OSHA applied this slope factor in a log-relative risk model and estimated the lifetime lung cancer mortality risk to be 13 per 1,000 for 45 years of exposure to 0.1 mg/m3respirable crystalline silica. For the proposed PEL of 0.05 mg/m3and proposed action level of 0.025 mg/m3, the lifetime risks are estimated to be 6 and 3 deaths per 1,000, respectively. The range of risks estimated to result from 45 years of exposure to the current construction and shipyard PELs is from 37 to 95 deaths per 1,000 workers., 305067=A series of studies of the diatomaceous earth industry (Checkoway et al., 1993, 1996, 1997, 1999) demonstrated positive exposure-response trends between cristobalite exposures and lung cancer as well as non-malignant respiratory disease mortality (NMRD). Checkoway et al. (1993) developed a Ã¢Â€Âœsemi-quantitativeÃ¢Â€? cumulative exposure estimate that demonstrated a statistically significant positive exposure-response trend (p = 0.026) between duration of employment or cumulative exposure and lung cancer mortality. The quartile analysis showed a monotonic increase in lung cancer mortality, with the highest exposure quartile having a RR of 2.74 for lung cancer mortality. Checkoway et al. (1996) conducted a re-analysis to address criticisms of potential confounding due to asbestos and again demonstrated a positive exposure response risk gradient when controlling for asbestos exposure and other variables. Rice et al. (2001) conducted a re-analysis and quantitative risk assessment of the Checkoway et al. (1997) study, which OSHA has included as part of its assessment of lung cancer mortality risk (See Section II, Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment)., 287586=Among the 504 workers whose last chest x-ray was classified as ILO 0/0 or 0/1, 20 percent had experienced onset of silicosis (i.e., chest x-ray was classified as ILO 1/0 by the time of follow up in 1990-1991), and 4.8 percent progressed to at least category 2. However, there are no data available to continue following the progression of this group because there have been no follow-up surveys of this cohort since 1991., 119161=OSHA currently enforces permissible exposure limits (PELs) for respirable crystalline silica in general industry, construction, and shipyards. These PELs were adopted in 1971, shortly after the Agency was created, and have not been updated since then. The PEL for quartz (the most common form of crystalline silica) in general industry is a formula that is approximately equivalent to 100 micrograms per cubic meter of air (ÃŽÂ¼g/m3) as an 8-hour time-weighted average. The PEL for quartz in construction and shipyards is a formula based on a now-obsolete particle count sampling method that is approximately equivalent to 250 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3. The current PELs for two other forms of crystalline silica (cristobalite and tridymite) are one-half of the values for quartz in general industry. OSHA is proposing a new PEL for respirable crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite) of 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3in all industry sectors covered by the rule. OSHA is also proposing other elements of a comprehensive health standard, including requirements for exposure assessment, preferred methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping., 231550=The courts have further observed that granting companies reasonable time to comply with new PELs may enhance economic feasibility. The Lead I case at 1265. While a standard must be economically feasible, the Supreme Court has held that a cost-benefit analysis of health standards is not required by the Act because a feasibility analysis is required. The Cotton Dust case, 453 U.S. at 509., 127023=Executive Orders 13563 and 12866 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives. Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule has been designated an economically significant regulatory action under section 3(f)(1) of Executive Order 12866. Accordingly, the rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, and the remainder of this section summarizes the key findings of the analysis with respect to costs and benefits of the rule and then presents several possible alternatives to the rule., 191995=30. OSHA's Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health (ACCSH) has historically advised the Agency to take into consideration the unique nature of construction work environments by either setting separate standards or making accommodations for the differences in work environments in construction as compared to general industry. ASTM, for example, has separate silica standards of practice for general industry and construction, E 1132-06 and E 2625-09, respectively. To account for differences in the workplace environments for these different sectors, OSHA has proposed separate standards for general industry/maritime and construction. Is this approach necessary and appropriate? What other approaches, if any, should the Agency consider? Provide a rationale for your response., 239916=In 1994, OSHA launched a process to determine which safety and health hazards in the U.S. needed most attention. A priority planning committee included safety and health experts from OSHA, NIOSH, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). The committee reviewed available information on occupational deaths, injuries, and illnesses and held an extensive dialogue with representatives of labor, industry, professional and academic organizations, the States, voluntary standards organizations, and the public. The National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health and the Advisory Committee on Construction Safety and Health also made recommendations. Rulemaking for crystalline silica exposure was one of the priorities designated by this process. OSHA indicated that crystalline silica would be added to the Agency's regulatory agenda as other standards were completed and resources became available., 494710=Although most workers with early-stage silicosis (ILO categories 0/1 or 1/0) typically do not experience respiratory symptoms, the primary risk to the affected worker is progression of disease with progressive decline of lung function. Several studies of workers exposed to crystalline silica have shown that, once silicosis is detected by x-ray, a substantial proportion of affected workers can progress beyond ILO category 1 silicosis, even after exposure has ceased (for example, Hughes et al., 1982; Hessel et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1998; Ng et al., 1987a; Yang et al., 2006). In a population of coal miners whose last chest x-ray while employed was classified as major category 0, and who were examined again 10 years after the mine had closed, 20 percent had developed opacities consistent with a classification of at least 1/0, and 4 percent progressed further to at least 2/1 (Miller et al., 1998). Although there were periods of extremely high exposure to respirable quartz in the mine (greater than 2 mg/m3in some jobs between 1972 and 1976, and more than 10 percent of exposures between 1969 and 1977 were greater than 1 mg/m3), the mean cumulative exposure for the cohort over the period 1964-1978 was 1.8 mg/m3-years, corresponding to an average silica concentration of 0.12 mg/m3. In a population of granite quarry workers exposed to an average respirable silica concentration of 0.48 mg/m3(mean length of employment was 23.4 years), 45 percent of those diagnosed with simple silicosis showed radiological progression of disease after 2 to 10 years of follow up (Ng et al., 1987a). Among a population of gold miners, 92 percent progressed in 14 years; exposures of high-, medium-, and low-exposure groups were 0.97, 0.45, and 0.24 mg/m3, respectively (Hessel et al., 1988). Chinese mine and factory workers categorized under the Chinese system of x-ray classification as Ã¢Â€ÂœsuspectedÃ¢Â€? silicosis cases (analogous to ILO 0/1) had a progression rate to stage I (analogous to ILO major category 1) of 48.7 percent and the average interval was about 5.1 years (Yang et al., 2006). These and other studies discussed in the Health Effects section are of populations of workers exposed to average concentrations of respirable crystalline silica above those permitted by OSHA's current general industry PEL. The studies, however, are of interest to OSHA because the Agency's current enforcement data indicate that exposures in this range are still common in some industry sectors. Furthermore, the Agency's preliminary risk assessment is based on use of an exposure metric that is less influenced by exposure pattern and, instead, characterizes the accumulated exposure of workers over time. Further, the use of a cumulative exposure metric reflects the progression of silica-related diseases: While it is not known that silicosis is a precursor to lung cancer, continued exposure to respirable crystalline silica among workers with silicosis has been shown to be associated with malignant respiratory disease (Chen et al., 1992). The Chinese pottery workers study offers an example of silicosis-associated lung cancer among workers in the clay industry, reflecting the variety of health outcomes associated with diverse silica exposures across industrial settings., 107989=Fax: If your submissions, including attachments, are not longer than 10 pages, you may fax them to the OSHA Docket Office at (202) 693-1648., 283165=Data on silicosis mortality and morbidity are likely to understate the true impact of exposure of U.S. workers to crystalline silica. This is in part due to underreporting that is characteristic of passive case-based disease surveillance systems that rely on the health care community to generate records (Froines et al., 1989). Health care professionals play the main role in such surveillance by virtue of their unique role in recognizing and diagnosing diseases, but most health care professionals do not take occupational histories (Goldman and Peters, 1981; Rutstein et al., 1983). In addition to the lack of information about exposure histories, difficulty in recognizing occupational illnesses that have long latency periods, like silicosis, contributes to under-recognition and underreporting by health care providers. Based on an analysis of data from Michigan's silicosis surveillance activities, Rosenman et al. (2003) estimated that the true incidence of silicosis mortality and morbidity were understated by a factor of between 2.5 and 5, and that there were estimated to be from 3,600 to 7,300 new cases of silicosis occurring in the U.S. annually between 1987 and 1996. Taken with the surveillance data presented above, OSHA believes that exposure to crystalline silica remains a cause of significant mortality and morbidity in the U.S., 264478=This section presents a summary of OSHA's review of the health effects literature for respirable crystalline silica. OSHA's full analysis is contained in Section I of the background document entitled Ã¢Â€ÂœRespirable Crystalline SilicaÃ¢Â€Â”Health Effects Literature Review and Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment,Ã¢Â€? which has been placed in rulemaking docket OSHA-2010-0034. OSHA's review of the literature on the adverse effects associated with exposure to crystalline silica covers the following topics:, 353144=OSHA has reviewed numerous studies on the relationship of silica exposure to pulmonary function impairment as measured by spirometry. There were several longitudinal studies available. Two groups of researchers conducted longitudinal studies of lung function impairment in Vermont granite workers and reached opposite conclusions. Graham et al (1981, 1994) examined stone shed workers, who had the highest exposures to respirable crystalline silica (between 50 and 100 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3), along with quarry workers (presumed to have lower exposure) and office workers (expected to have negligible exposure). The longitudinal losses of FVC and FEV 1 were not correlated with years employed, did not differ among shed, quarry, and office workers, and were similar, according to the authors, to other blue collar workers not exposed to occupational dust., 106632=Hearing testimony and documentary evidence. Interested persons who request more than 10 minutes to present testimony, or who intend to submit documentary evidence, at the hearings must submit (transmit, send, postmark, deliver) the full text of their testimony and all documentary evidence by December 11, 2013. See Section XV below for details on the format and how to file a notice of intention to appear, submit documentary evidence at the hearing, and request an appropriate amount of time to present testimony., 742397=United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CIC v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1272 (D.C. Cir. 1980)., 107449=Written comments. You may submit comments, identified by Docket No. OSHA-2010-0034, by any of the following methods:, 752137=For the OSHA XRD Method ID-142 (revised December 1996), precision is Ã‚Â±23 percent at a working range of 50 to 160 Ã‚Âµg crystalline silica, and the SAE (sampling and analytical error) is Ã‚Â±19 percent. The NIOSH and MSHA XRD and IR methods report a similar degree of precision. OSHA's Salt Lake Technical Center (SLTC) evaluated the precision of ID-142 at lower filter loadings and has shown an acceptable level of precision is achieved at filter loadings of approximately 40 Ã‚Âµg and 20 Ã‚Âµg corresponding to the amounts collected from full-shift sampling at the proposed PEL and action level, respectively. This analysis showed that at filter loadings corresponding to the proposed PEL, the precision and SAE for quartz are Ã‚Â±17 and Ã‚Â±14 percent, respectively. For cristobalite, the precision and SAE are Ã‚Â±19 and Ã‚Â±16 percent, respectively. These results indicate that employers can have confidence in sampling results for the purpose of assessing compliance with the PEL and identifying when additional engineering and work practice controls and/or respiratory protection are needed., 318374=Four studies of gold miners were conducted in South Africa. Two case control studies (Hessel et al., 1986, 1990) reported no significant association between silica exposure and lung cancer, but these two studies may have underestimated risk, according to Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer (1991). Two cohort studies (Reid and Sluis-Cremer, 1996; Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1991) and their associated nested case-control studies found elevated SMRs and odds ratios, respectively, for lung cancer. Reid and Sluis-Cremer (1996) attributed the increased mortality due to lung cancer and other non-malignant respiratory diseases to cohort members' lifestyle choices (particularly smoking and alcohol consumption). However, OSHA notes that the study reported finding a positive, though not statistically significant, association between cumulative crystalline silica exposure and lung cancer, as well as statistically significant association with renal failure, COPD, and other respiratory diseases that have been implicated with silica exposure., 258587=Cristobalite is a form of crystalline silica that is formed at high temperatures (>1470 Ã‚Â°C). Although naturally occurring cristobalite is relatively rare, volcanic eruptions, such as Mount St. Helens, can release cristobalite dust into the air. Cristobalite can also be created during some processes conducted in the workplace. For example, flux-calcined diatomaceous earth is a material used as a filtering aid and as a filler in other products (IARC, 1997). It is produced when diatomaceous earth (diatomite), a geological product of decayed unicellular organisms called diatoms, is heated with flux. The finished product can contain between 40 and 60 percent cristobalite. Also, high temperature furnaces are often lined with bricks that contain quartz. When subjected to prolonged high temperatures, this quartz can convert to cristobalite., 192831=31. OSHA has proposed that the scope of the construction standard include all occupational exposures to respirable crystalline silica in construction work as defined in 29 CFR 1910.12(b) and covered under 29 CFR part 1926, rather than restricting the application of the rule to specific construction operations. Should OSHA modify the scope to limit what is covered? What should be included and what should be excluded? Provide a rationale for your position. Submit your proposed language for the scope and application provision., 232726=OSHA's current standards for workplace exposure to respirable crystalline silica were adopted in 1971, pursuant to section 6(a) of the OSH Act (36 FR 10466, May 29, 1971). Section 6(a) provided that in the first two years after the effective date of the Act, OSHA had to promulgate Ã¢Â€Âœstart-upÃ¢Â€? standards, on an expedited basis and without public hearing or comment, based on national consensus or established Federal standards that improved employee safety or health. Pursuant to that authority, OSHA in 1971 promulgated approximately 425 permissible exposure limits (PELs) for air contaminants, including silica, derived principally from Federal standards applicable to government contractors under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act, 41 U.S.C. 35, and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (commonly known as the Construction Safety Act), 40 U.S.C. 333. The Walsh-Healey Act and Construction Safety Act standards, in turn, had been adopted primarily from recommendations of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)., 301050=Based on its review, OSHA preliminarily concludes that the human data summarized in this section provides ample evidence that exposure to respirable crystalline silica increases the risk of lung cancer among workers. The strongest evidence comes from the worldwide cohort and case-control studies reporting excess lung cancer mortality among workers exposed to respirable crystalline silica dust as quartz in various industrial sectors, including the granite/stone quarrying and processing, industrial sand, mining, and pottery and ceramic industries, as well as to cristobalite in diatomaceous earth and refractory brick industries. The 10-cohort pooled case-control analysis by Steenland et al. (2001a) confirms these findings. A more recent clinic-based pooled case-control analysis of seven European countries by Cassidy et al. (2007) as well as two national death certificate registry studies (Pukkala et al., 2005 in Finland; Calvert et al., 2003 in the United States) support the findings from the cohort and case-control analysis., 236859=As information developed during the 1980s and 1990s, national and international classification organizations came to recognize crystalline silica as a human carcinogen. In June 1986, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) evaluated the available evidence regarding crystalline silica carcinogenicity and concluded that it was Ã¢Â€Âœprobably carcinogenic to humansÃ¢Â€? (IARC, 1987). An IARC working group met again in October 1996 to evaluate the complete body of research, including research that had been conducted since the initial 1986 evaluation. IARC concluded that Ã¢Â€Âœcrystalline silica inhaled in the form of quartz or cristobalite from occupational sources is carcinogenic to humansÃ¢Â€? (IARC, 1997)., 203608=52. In OSHA's cadmium standard (29 CFR 1910.1027(f)(1)(ii),(iii), and (iv)), the Agency established separate engineering control air limits (SECALs) for certain processes in selected industries. SECALs were established where compliance with the PEL by means of engineering and work practice controls was infeasible. For these industries, a SECAL was established at the lowest feasible level that could be achieved by engineering and work practice controls. The PEL was set at a lower level, and could be achieved by any allowable combination of controls, including respiratory protection. In OSHA's chromium (VI) standard (29 CFR 1910.1026), an exception similar to SECALs was made for painting airplanes and airplane parts. Should OSHA follow this approach for respirable crystalline silica in any industries or processes? If so, in what industries or processes, and at what exposure levels, should the SECALs be established? Provide the basis for your position and include supporting information., 115526=For general information and press inquiries, contact Frank Meilinger, Director, Office of Communications, Room N-3647, OSHA, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210; telephone (202) 693-1999.

Quantitative risk assessments for lung cancer and silicosis mortality were published after the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined more than a decade ago that there was sufficient evidence to regard crystalline silica as a human carcinogen (IARC, 1997). This finding was based on several studies of worker cohorts demonstrating associations between exposure to crystalline silica and an increased risk of lung cancer. Although IARC judged the overall evidence as being sufficient to support this conclusion, IARC also noted that some studies of crystalline silica-exposed workers did not demonstrate an excess risk of lung cancer and that exposure-response trends were not always consistent among studies that were able to describe such trends. These findings led Steenland et al. (2001a) and Mannetje et al. (2002b) to conduct comprehensive exposure-response analyses of the risk of lung cancer and silicosis mortality associated with exposure to crystalline silica. These studies, referred to as the IARC multi-center studies of lung cancer and silicosis mortality, relied on all available cohort data from previously published epidemiological studies for which there were adequate quantitative data on worker exposures to crystalline silica to derive pooled estimates of disease risk. In addition, OSHA identified four single-cohort studies of lung cancer mortality that it judged suitable for quantitative risk assessment; two of these cohorts (Attfield and Costello, 2004; Rice et al., 2001) were included among the 10 used in the IARC multi-center study and studies of two other cohorts appeared later (Hughes et al., 2001; McDonald et al., 2001, 2005; Miller and MacCalman, 2009). For non-malignant respiratory disease mortality, in addition to the silicosis mortality study by Mannetje et al. (2002b), Park et al. (2002) conducted an exposure-response analysis of non-malignant respiratory disease mortality (including silicosis and other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) among diatomaceous earth workers. Exposure-response analyses for silicosis morbidity have been published in several single-cohort studies (Chen et al., 2005; Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1993; Steenland and Brown, 1995b; Miller et al., 1998; Buchanan et al., 2003). Finally, a quantitative assessment of end-stage renal disease mortality based on data from three worker cohorts was developed by Steenland et al. (2002a)., 439735=Three thousand three hundred thirty South Dakota gold miners who had worked at least a year underground between 1940 and 1965 were studied by Steenland and Brown (1995b). Workers were followed though 1990 with 1,551 having died; loss to follow up was low (2 percent). Chest x-rays taken in cross-sectional surveys in 1960 and 1976 and death certificates were used to ascertain cases of silicosis. One hundred twenty eight cases were found via death certificate, 29 by x-ray (defined as ILO 1/1 or greater), and 13 by both. Nine percent of deaths had silicosis mentioned on the death certificate. Inclusion of death certificate diagnoses probably increases the risk estimates from this study compared to those that rely exclusively on radiographic findings to evaluate silicosis morbidity risk (see discussion of Hnizdo et al. (1993) above)., 321784=In addition, a recent analysis of 4.8 million death certificates from 27 states within the U.S. for the years 1982 to 1995 showed statistically significant excesses in lung cancer mortality, silicosis mortality, tuberculosis, and NMRD among persons with occupations involving medium and high exposure to respirable crystalline silica (Calvert et al., 2003). A national records and death certificate study was also conducted in Finland by Pukkala et al. (2005), who found a statistically significant excess of lung cancer incidence among men and women with estimated medium and heavy exposures. OSHA believes that these large national death certificate studies and the pooled European community-based case-control study are strongly supportive of the previously reviewed epidemiologic data and supports the conclusion that occupational exposure to crystalline silica is a risk factor for lung cancer mortality., 325160=Studies by Hnizdo et al. (1997), McLaughlin et al. (1992), Hughes et al. (2001), McDonald et al. (2001, 2005), Miller and MacCalman (2009), and Cassidy et al. (2007) had detailed smoking histories with sufficiently large populations and a sufficient number of years of follow-up time to quantify the interaction between crystalline silica exposure and cigarette smoking. In a cohort of white South African gold miners (Hnizdo and Sluis-Cremer, 1991) and in the follow-up nested case-control study (Hnizdo et al., 1997) found that the combined effect of exposure to respirable crystalline silica and smoking was greater than additive, suggesting a multiplicative effect. This synergy appeared to be greatest for miners with greater than 35 pack-years of smoking and higher cumulative exposure to silica. In the Chinese nested case-control studies reported by McLaughlin et al. (1992), cigarette smoking was associated with lung cancer, but control for smoking did not influence the association between silica and lung cancer in the mining and pottery cohorts studied. The studies of industrial sand workers by Hughes et al. (2001) and British coal workers by Miller and MacCalman (2009) found positive exposure-response trends after adjusting for smoking histories, as did Cassidy et al. (2007) in their community-based case-control study of exposed European workers., 870708=The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has long held that OSHA standards are economically feasible so long as their costs do not threaten the existence of, or cause massive economic dislocations within, a particular industry or alter the competitive structure of that industry. American Iron and Steel Institute. v. OSHA, 939 F.2d 975, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1991); United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC v. Marshall, 647 F.2d 1189, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Industrial Union Department v. Hodgson, 499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)., 434652=Chest radiography is not the most sensitive tool used to diagnose or detect silicosis. In 1993, Hnizdo et al. reported the results of a study that compared autopsy and radiological findings of silicosis in a cohort of 557 white South African gold miners. The average period from last x-ray to autopsy was 2.7 years. Silicosis was not diagnosed radiographically for over 60 percent of the miners for whom pathological examination of lung tissue showed slight to marked silicosis. The likelihood of false negatives (negative by x-ray, but silicosis is actually present) increased with years of mining and average dust exposure of the miners. The low sensitivity seen for radiographic evaluation suggests that risk estimates derived from radiographic evidence likely understate the true risk of developing fibrotic lesions as a result of exposure to crystalline silica., 852503=As shown in Table V-10 in the PEA, the estimated unit cost of the initial health screening for current employees in general industry and maritime ranges from approximately $378 to $397 and includes direct medical costs, the opportunity cost of worker time (i.e., lost work time, evaluated at the worker's 2009 hourly wage, including fringe benefits) for offsite travel and for the initial health screening itself, and recordkeeping costs. The variation in the unit cost of the initial health screening is due entirely to differences in the percentage of workers expected to travel offsite for the health screening. In OSHA's experience, the larger the establishment the more likely it is that the selected PLHCP would provide the health screening services at the establishment's worksite. OSHA estimates that 20 percent of establishments with fewer than 20 employees, 75 percent of establishments with 20-499 employees, and 100 percent of establishments with 500 or more employees would have the initial health screening for current employees conducted onsite., 845723=ERG (2013) used respirator cost information from a 2003 OSHA respirator study to estimate the annual cost of $570 (in 2009 dollars) for a half-mask, non-powered, air-purifying respirator and $638 per year (in 2009 dollars) for a full-face non-powered air-purifying respirator (ERG, 2003). These unit costs reflect the annualized cost of respirator use, including accessories (e.g., filters), training, fit testing, and cleaning., 562990=The Supreme Court's benzene decision of 1980, discussed above in this section, states that Ã¢Â€Âœbefore he can promulgate any permanent health or safety standard, the Secretary [of Labor] is required to make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafeÃ¢Â€Â”in the sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices.Ã¢Â€? Benzene, 448 U.S. at 642. While making it clear that it is up to the Agency to determine what constitutes a significant risk, the Court offered general guidance on the level of risk OSHA might determine to be significant., 613230=OSHA has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) in accordance with the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as amended in 1996. Among the contents of the IRFA are an analysis of the potential impact of the proposed rule on small entities and a description and discussion of significant alternatives to the proposed rule that OSHA has considered. The IRFA is presented in its entirety both in Chapter IX of the PEA and in Section VIII.I of this preamble., 235416=In 1974, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) evaluated crystalline silica as a workplace hazard and issued criteria for a recommended standard on occupational exposure to crystalline silica (NIOSH, 1974). NIOSH recommended that occupational exposure to crystalline silica be controlled so that no worker is exposed to a time-weighted average (TWA) of free (respirable crystalline) silica greater than 50 ÃŽÂ¼g/m3as determined by a full-shift sample for up to a 10-hour workday, 40-hour workweek. The document also recommended a number of ancillary provisions for a standard, such as exposure monitoring and medical surveillance., 432168=OSHA's estimates of renal disease mortality appear in Table VI-2. Based on the life table analysis, OSHA estimates that exposure to the current (0.10 mg/m3) and proposed general industry PEL (0.0.05 mg/m3) over a working life would result in a lifetime excess renal disease risk of 39 (95% CI 2-200) and 32 (95% CI 1.7-147) deaths per 1,000, respectively. For exposure to the current construction/shipyard PEL, OSHA estimates the excess lifetime risk to range from 52 (95% CI 2.2-289) to 63 (95% CI 2.5-368) deaths per 1,000 workers., 234182=For general industry (see 29 CFR 1910.1000, Table Z-3), the PEL for crystalline silica in the form of respirable quartz is based on two alternative formulas: (1) A particle-count formula, PEL mppcf= 250/(% quartz + 5); and (2) a mass formula proposed by ACGIH in 1968, PEL = (10 mg/m3)/(% quartz + 2). The general industry PELs for cristobalite and tridymite are one-half of the value calculated from either of the above two formulas. For construction (29 CFR 1926.55, Appendix A) and shipyards (29 CFR 1915.1000, Table Z), the formula for the PEL for crystalline silica in the form of quartz (PEL mppcf= 250/(% quartz + 5)), which requires particle counting, is derived from the 1970 ACGIH threshold limit value (TLV).2 The formula based on particle-counting technology used in the general industry, construction, and shipyard PELs is now considered obsolete., 859597=OSHA estimated separate costs for initial training of current employees and for training new hires. Given that new-hire training might need to be performed frequently during the year, OSHA estimated a smaller class size for new hires. OSHA anticipates that training, in accordance with the requirements of the proposed rule, will be conducted by in-house safety or supervisory staff with the use of training modules or videos and will last, on average, one hour. ERG (2007b) judged that establishments could purchase sufficient training materials at an average cost of $2 per worker, encompassing the cost of handouts, video presentations, and training manuals and exercises. ERG (2013) included in the cost estimates for training the value of worker and trainer time as measured by 2009 hourly wage rates (to include fringe benefits). ERG also developed estimates of average class sizes as a function of establishment size. For initial training, ERG estimated an average class size of 5 workers for establishments with fewer than 20 employees, 10 workers for establishments with 20 to 499 employees, and 20 workers for establishments with 500 or more employees. For new hire training, ERG estimated an average class size of 2 workers for establishments with fewer than 20 employees, 5 workers for establishments with 20 to 499 employees, and 10 workers for establishments with 500 or more employees., 111277=Notice of intention to appear, hearing testimony and documentary evidence. You may submit (transmit, send, postmark, deliver) your notice of intention to appear, hearing testimony, and documentary evidence, identified by docket number (OSHA-2010-0034), by any of the following methods:, 105074=Written comments. Written comments, including comments on the information collection determination described in Section IX of the preamble (OMB Review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995), must be submitted (postmarked, sent, or received) by December 11, 2013., 354064=Eisen et al. (1983, 1995) found the opposite. They looked at lung function in two groups of granite workers: Ã¢Â€ÂœsurvivorsÃ¢Â€?, who participated in each of five annual physical exams, and Ã¢Â€ÂœdropoutsÃ¢Â€?, who did not participate in the final exam. There was a significant exposure-response relationship between exposure to crystalline silica and FEV 1 decline among the dropouts but not among the survivors. The dropout group had a steeper FEV 1 loss, and this was true for each smoking category. The authors concluded that exposures of about 50 ug/m3produced a measurable effect on pulmonary function in the dropouts. Eisen et al. (1995) felt that the Ã¢Â€Âœhealthy worker effectÃ¢Â€? was apparent in this study and that studies that only looked at Ã¢Â€ÂœsurvivorsÃ¢Â€? would be less likely to see any effect of silica on pulmonary function., 279064=From 1968 to 2002, silicosis was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause of death on 16,305 death certificates; of these, a total of 15,944 (98 percent) deaths occurred in males (CDC, 2005). From 1968 to 2002, the number of silicosis deaths decreased from 1,157 (8.91 per million persons aged Ã¢Â‰Â¥ 15 years) to 148 (0.66 per million), corresponding to a 93-percent decline in the overall mortality rate. In its most recent WoRLD Report (NIOSH, 2008c), NIOSH reported that the number of silicosis deaths in 2003, 2004, and 2005 were 179, 166, and 161, respectively, slightly higher than that reported in 2002. The number of silicosis deaths identified each year has remained fairly constant since the late 1990's., 885050=The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), Pub. L. No. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (codified at 5 U.S.C. 601), requires Federal agencies to consider the economic impact that a proposed rulemaking will have on small entities. The RFA states that whenever a Federal agency is required to publish general notice of proposed rulemaking for any proposed rule, the agency must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA). 5 U.S.C. 603(a). Pursuant to section 605(b), in lieu of an IRFA, the head of an agency may certify that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification must be supported by a factual basis. If the head of an agency makes a certification, the agency shall publish such certification in the Federal Register at the time of publication of general notice of proposed rulemaking or at the time of publication of the final rule. 5 U.S.C. 605(b).}",

Mosquitoes prefer stagnant water, like an uncirculated pond or fountain, or other moist conditions such as flowerbeds, flowerpot saucers, unkempt gutters, sprinkler heads, or shady areas. In addition to their annoyance, controlling and repelling mosquitoes is essential to minimizing the risk of contracting the many diseases carried by mosquitoes such as Dengue Fever, Encephalitis, Malaria, and dog-heartworm.
