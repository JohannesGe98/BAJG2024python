The low In-state tuition has allowed me to take my core classes at a very acceptable and reasonable price. The campus is beautiful and the new dining hall is very deserving of appraisal. The services on campus are excellent for the cost of attending, and the price is perfect for the quality of education received. I'm sure we will see tuition costs rise dramatically very soon, as the introduction of a football team in 2014 will be spark some increased interest in this tuition state-wide, and possibly even nation-wide., 607735=There isn't going to be a football team until Fall 2015 but there's still Homecoming.

Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment.

The culminating aim of the numerous fraternities and sororities on campus is to destroy the bad reputation of college Greek life, providing clean, wholesome, and fellowship-friendly environments for students of similar backgrounds and interests to enjoy planning events, communicating with the student body, and often sponsoring or fundraising designed to promote the self-sufficient Greek life system on campus.', 'The social and academic clubs and organizations offered to Kennesaw State University students are not only extremely well organized and managed, but also provide excellent opportunities for the students of such a large institution to meet and form relationships with other students, connecting the entire student body in a very relational way. Kennesaw offers everything from intramural sporting activities, to religious and ethnic clubs, to international seminars, and to visual and musical artistic organizations. The University has truly perfected its ability to outreach and connect to the large amount of students who attend, as well as bringing a sense of unity to commuting, international, and working students who would normally not have such opportunities at other institutions of the size and magnitude of Kennesaw State University.', 'Kennesaw State University is an excellent school for students who are passionate about studying, seeking professors and staff who enjoy their responsibility to educate future leaders, for students who wish to have access to multiple University events and sports, a simple commute to anywhere in the surrounding Atlanta area, and for those who truly enjoy the benefits of hard work and studying. Kennesaw professors and courses are designed to grow those who are motivated to learn, inspire, and lead others. The campus is also extremely family friendly and compatible for all types of working and family members seeking a college education.', 'The lawn, as it is known to students familiar with the campus, is not only the center of the main Kennesaw University Campus, but also is traditionally the place with the most activity and events on any given day. Along with the numerous amount of students simply studying or resting along the perimeter of this relatively quiet area of campus, many local bands play on the lawn as their local venue, Greek life and student clubs host special events, and the student body as a whole has been known to conduct intramural activities and hire outside entertainment to be provided to students on the University lawn.', 'In terms of academic quality, students truly receive the quality education they are paying for, yet at an affordable price. Kennesaw State University is also very cooperative to transferring students, providing credit for the majority of other college or university equivalent courses.', 'The Kennesaw area has multiple well known restaurant chains, as well as many locally owned businesses and services to take advantage of in terms of things-to-do. Visiting the conveniently located Town Center Mall provides a very clean, safe environment to shop and eat. Also available and close-by to students living on campus are the school sporting events, including state-of-the-art fields, stadiums, and courts designed to provide a great all-around experience to bother young and old athletic fans alike.', 'The dinning services at Kennesaw State University uphold excellent standards in terms of food preparation, presentation, and quality. In comparison to other Universities, Kennesaw dining goes above and beyond the required specifications, providing quality food and service throughout the entire academic year. The food itself is never tasteless, over-cooked, or dissatisfying.', 'Although I am a commuting student, I have multiple friends and acquaintances who reside in dorms at Kennesaw State University, and I have only heard great things about the condition of the units, neighbors, and services within the dorms. All of the dorm options on campus are extremely spacious, in excellent condition, and are nearly flawless in terms of aesthetics.', 'Kennesaw State University is not an easy college in terms of academia by any standards. However, like most large universities, Kennesaw also employs professors who are more focused upon providing busy work in order to advance their own research than educating the students. I have only personally encountered this once however, and it should not be considered an adequate reflection of the rigor of the University.', 'I would advise future students to study a map of the campus in order to have a general idea of buildings and classes in relation to their location and classes. I would also advise weekly meetings with each professor in order to establish a grounded student-teacher relationship. I would advice upperclassmen to consider commuting in order to save on living expenses and have the ability to work part-time off campus.', 'Kennesaw State University is a great school for commuters, study-abroad students and very technologically interactive. The campus itself is extremely clean, well staffed, and contains well qualified and dedicated professors in each field. The school does a fantastic job at making everything very accessible and student-friendly.']]",Kennesaw State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kennesaw-State-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/19827,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,88,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00076-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,908903175,908749297,HORIZONTAL,"01/17/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 31 out of 33 people found this review useful. 1 of 179 Alicia from Kennesaw, GA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It's a great location and campus police are friendly, but they get the job done. Talking to an officer is great because they make you feel safe and let you know they're here for our safety. They are usually retired officers from all over so they know what they are doing. There are also RAD self defense classes available for those who want extra security."", ""My roommate is pledging, and she enjoys it. She's met quite a few people from it and I think she has no regrets. Our Greeks are deeply involved in service, but then again so is the entire KSU family. Make sure you check the fraternity and sorority website for more details."", ""The diversity of clubs and activities is frustrating because it's no way you can do them all. There's something for everyone and if not, it's easy to start. We even have a paintball team!"", ""Kennesaw is great for ALL types of students. It's still transitioning from being a commuter school, so those who like tradition may want to consider somewhere else. Or, they can do as our new club does and start tradition! The motto of the new club KSU Black and Gold is tradition begins here. Academically, KSU is great for all types of students that want to further themselves and not only get a degree, but get a career after college."", ""Our homecoming this year is for volleyball instead of the usual basketball (we're still working on getting a football team.) If you see the big round circles on the ground near the Village and the Village Suites, go to the center and clap. (Not every time, but what happens next is a sort of cool surprise.) We're currently getting ready for Monster Ball at the end of October! Make sure you explore the hidden nooks and crannies on campus, like the gazebo near the Social Sciences building. Visit for more traditions!"", ""Depending on where you're coming from, it may or may not seem expensive. I'm from Georgia, so the in state tuition and Zell Miller scholarship helped me out. This school is worth the money if you take advantage of everything you pay for. Check you're OWL express account and look at the balances. You'll see that you pay for certain fees that most people might overlook. Go to the gym, talk to your RA, attend the workshops that interest you, and excel in your classes. Now is the most important time than ever to take advantage of your education, because you're paying for it. At Kennesaw, they try to give you plenty of opportunities to get bang for your buck."", 'There is literally always something going on around campus. There is also some type of workshop, fitness class, cookout, or anything you can imagine. There are plenty of clubs to join. Students get points for going to sporting events which eventually add up to prizes. If you know the right people, the party scene is fantastic. This is not at all a party school, but all I will say is there are plenty of opportunities to party.', ""The Commons was nationally ranked or something like that, and the food is really good. Don't be afraid to try some of the different eateries. The dessert round-about is amazing, so make sure you know where the gym is. And if you every get tired of the whole burgers, fries, and pizza routine, there are other options in the Commons as well as outside. The Peace Cafe in the University Village Suites is really really really good. They can get pricey, but it is worth it. The Hoot is located in University Village and is very popular for late night eating. It's quick, they accept meal plan swipes, and everything I've had from there is good. There are also places around that give discounts with your campus ID like Wendy's, Waffle House and etc. There are plenty of options, and I don't have any complaints."", ""I LOVE my apartment. I'm in University Village, a freshman dorm, and the word dorm is an understatement. It's basically an apartment with a kitchen, furniture in the common area, and everyone gets their own bathroom. The Village Suites are slightly more traditional college style with a kitchen for the entire floor, residents share a bathroom, but they get their own room. The only problem that I hear students complain about is the wifi. Overall, I recommend looking at ksuhousing.com and visiting the school in person."", ""Classes are challenging because they wake you up to a whole new experience. It's a completely different style of teaching than most high school students are used to and requires a different type of studying. It might be hard to learn exactly what you need to understand or study from a lecture, but professors are understanding. If you make an effort in class, read the syllabus, and talk to the professor with any concerns, you should do fine."", ""Make sure you have a clear way to pay for things. Consider work study, getting a job, or do as many scholarships as possible. It's a lot more expensive than you think! If you go to the Waffle House late at night (which I'm sure you will) speak to Ms. Regina. And the wifi here isn't that great in residential areas. Visit somebody's dorm to get a real experience before making a decision about where you live. Find someone who's already been here to guide you. Get informed and get involved. You won't regret it."", ""This is a great school depending on what you're looking for. The professors and students alike are GREAT.

Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment.

Emergency boxes are everywhere as well, just in case, and the KSU police do provide escort service, especially for all the ladies out there at night time who would rather have peace-of-mind when traveling back to their dorms. Overall, the campus is quite safe and the police response to any issues is within minutes.', 'I do not have much experience with the Greek life on campus, but I do know that one drawback is that no common houses for each Fraternity or Sorority are allowed at KSU. If you expected to live in a Greek house, sadly this is not the place for you. Otherwise the groups meet at the KSU student center and still plan a host of events!', 'There are too many clubs and activities to list. Some include: sports clubs, hobby clubs, religious clubs, and more!', ""If you don't like the idea of a massive campus, but do like the idea of still having plenty of students walking around, this is the place for you. KSU is up-and-coming and soon to finalize its football agenda."", 'What can I say, you have to be here to experience much of the traditions. Greek life always has something planned.', 'The tuition prices are great for the quality of professors here, as well as overall experience. The only issue is if you live on campus, housing can become expensive, compared to off-campus accommodations. The meal-plan is also decently priced in respect to the unlimited food you have access to once inside the dining hall, which is named The Commons. Again, the unlimited plan is overkill and buying a smaller sub 200 meal plan is a more down-to-earth money saver.', 'The green is a nice place to relax and throw some frisbee, or even take a nice walk. Concerts and other events seem to be thrown for students every few weeks, so there is always something to look forward to! KSU also has its own wellness center equipped with a ton of exercise equipment and resources!', 'The food here is very delicious, and the only reason it did not garner 5 out of 5 stars is because it can get repetitive. Burgers and pizza every other day as alternatives to eating the gourmet flare meals, which can sometimes taste rather different, can become tiring. The food is touted to be very healthy, most of which is organic and sourced in the vicinity of Kennesaw.', 'A variety of dorms surround the campus exterior, and provide a nice place to live. The dorms are styled like apartments, and really make you feel at home. Residence life is also helpful.', ""Classes here are definitely tough. Smaller sized colleges are sometimes wrongly attributed to easy A's, but this is not one of them. Trust me, the science program is more than a challenge."", 'Living on, or at least near campus is easier than the commute, especially being in close proximity to Atlanta traffic. Do not buy the unlimited meal plan, no matter what your stomach tells you, it is not worth the extra cost in the end. Enjoy yourself when you get here!', 'Kennesaw is an up-and-coming college, growing each day in student body and size. Campus life is calmed, yet abundant.

I have been trying for months to get my parents to let me go far away for school, but being close by my family is a lot better than being far away. KSU allows me to be close to areas where there are activities while also being close to family. So don't rule the school out if you live near by. When choosing your parking area make sure that you look at your schedule for school. There is nothing worse than choosing a parking area that is on the opposite side of the campus. If you are not a morning person, do NOT take an 8 am class. You will not get up for class, and it is a waste of yours or your parents money if you fail the class for not attending it. When you sign up for your classes, make sure you keep a balanced load. You do not want your entire schedule to consist of extremely difficult courses. Start out simple for your first semester. You will get extremely stressed and frustrated if you overwork yourself. Make sure to study everyday. Having days where you do not study at all, is amazing when your in the moment. But later on your realize that you may have needed it at the time. So study for just an hour on days you have no classes. Get involved. Going to a game with friends, or joining a Greek society is a great way to make friends and stay involved in the school."", 'Kennesaw is a great school with tons of social, academic, and recreational activities to become involved in.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment. The cost for books is great too because i paid less than $500 for this semesters books, and i should get most of it back at the end of the semester. Am enjoying being here The social life in Kennesaw is so friendly. Everyone has a place",True,0,0,"{491969=The Greek Life is definitely growing here.

Kennesaw is getting a football program in 2014 and there is always intramurel sports, 742066=Our student dining hall is ranked one of the highest in the nation and has even beat out those at culinary schools. We have several other dining choices on campus that accept the meal plan as well. The food is delicious and there is a good variety, by fall of 2014 we should have a new taco bar as well., 14051=KSU is rapidly growing and constantly changing - it's an exciting time to be an Owl! The dining hall, The Commons, was added in fall 2009 and a new soccer stadium (where the Atlanta Beat soccer team plays) opened in May 2010. A football team is expected in 2014. The dorms are great because you get your own bedroom regardless of which of the four communities you live in., 226638=Kennesaw has a very diverse population and is accommodating to all types of students, not just traditional high school graduates. It offers clases online for the non-traditional student who may not have time for going to campus or night classes, as well as classes starting from 7:30 am ending at 10:15pm for the students who want to come to class before or after work. There are a number of hybrid classes, and classes offered at the center for continuing education for specific certifications that don't require even being a Kennesaw student. There is a variety of major options and graduate school options so that anyone seeking almost any degree is welcomed and will be taken care of there., 566345=It varies; I remember my ENGL 1101 class was way easier than the equivalent high school course, AP Language and Composition. In contrast, I struggled through CHEM 1211, but in high school I breezed through Chemistry., 833037=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 76275=I will learn about KSU when I attend the walking tour they have in July. They also have a session set up for adult learners in August before school starts., 609477=I've never lived on campus. I live close by, in off-campus housing. More and more off-campus housing is opening each year and the shuttle buses stop at them. From my friends places, the housing is better than other schools. You don't share bedrooms. May have to share a bathroom depending on the floor plan you choose., 319451=I commuted, so I don't have an opinion on this one. But my friends that lived on campus loved it. I have been inside them before (hanging out with friends), and they are very nice, especially the new ones. They are building even more now, since our attendance continues to explode, so I'm sure those will be state-of-the-art, environment-friendly like the other ones too! They will be available around Fall 2012, Summer 2013 I think., 318496=AWESOME dining hall. We got The Commons in 2010, and it has never disappointed. Even students with food allergies can find something tasty to eat there! And if not, the cooks are way cool that they will MAKE something for you! Sweet, huh? They are also environmentally aware. They collaborate with farmers and local growers for their food, and use water sparingly. Even the toilets have a system to cut down on water use! There are many stations- an Asian, ethnic, all-American, pizza/pasta, soul, greens/fruits, sandwich, all kinds! And then there are themes to the food stations- from Greek, to African, to Thai, and everything in between! Yum... seriously, good stuff., 139861=we have tons of sports and intramural activities to chose from. we have everything from tennis to camping. the only sport we don't seem to have is football, but we are planning to have a team in 2014., 104986=There are many things around campus to do, such as hookah bars, if youre into that kind of thing. In 2015 there will be a football team so tailgating will be an option. Many people hang out in each others dorms since they are so big., 571296=In 2009 I lived in the freshman housing and it was pretty decent. They kept everything clean in the building and their were monthly fire drills. KSU housing department tends to have events for students living there,for example: movie nights, parties, and casino night, so I would defiantly recommend freshman trying to find their way on their own and in college live on campus. If you do not wish to live on campus, there are many college style housing located around the campus that the B.O.B (Big Owl Bus) provides transportation to and from school., 775750=This school has everything, or at least it will by Fall 2015. The dorms are the ridiculously high quality- even the worst dorms are better than some of the best dorms on other campuses. With the renovations and additions to so many buildings, there's no way but up from here., 773205=Those emergency buttons and call stations are everywhere, the KSU police is everywhere. They take every report seriously. I have never even once begun to feel unsafe on campus. Also, ask anyone from the class of 2017 about the fire alarms in the University Village Suites. Let's just say there's no way there will ever be a fire that all of the Suites doesn't know about.., 21474=Tuition cost is, by far, the best thing about Kennesaw State University. The low In-state tuition has allowed me to take my core classes at a very acceptable and reasonable price. The campus is beautiful and the new dining hall is very deserving of appraisal. The services on campus are excellent for the cost of attending, and the price is perfect for the quality of education received. I'm sure we will see tuition costs rise dramatically very soon, as the introduction of a football team in 2014 will be spark some increased interest in this tuition state-wide, and possibly even nation-wide., 607735=There isn't going to be a football team until Fall 2015 but there's still Homecoming.

There are a lot of great clubs to choose from, especially for international students!', 'Kennesaw State University is great for students that want a university feel but not to be overwhelmed by a gigantic campus. It is good for students who do not have cars either. if not living on campus, there are many close by apartment complexes that are in walking distance or may even have the B.O.B. bus stop there. It is also a great school for people who want a homey or close nit feel. the school is a good enough size that it, like i said before, feels like a university but is comfortable and easy to make friends there, and many will know each other.', ""One place you'll see everyone on a beautiful day is The Campus Green. Everyone will have brought out their hammocks and Frisbees. You may even see a few people whip out their tight ropes and have them tied to the tree trunks! There are always usuals you will see gathered around the sectioned smoking sections around campus that seem to be a hangout spot along with the small amphitheater near the social science building. Not really any strange traditions but you will get used to seeing people zoom by you on their long boards and bikes on their way to class."", 'Kennesaw is very well priced for the education that you are going to get, along with the professors and beautiful campus. Dorms are a bit more pricey but they are definitely worth the money, they come fully equipped!', 'There are a few places around Kennesaw that are fun; some good bars, Town Center Mall ( which has the owl bus access), movie theaters, Kennesaw Mountain, and Lake Acworth is close by for nice days. And atlanta isnt too far away either. But even just chilling on campus and sitting on the green is great, when the weather is nice, everyone is out here enjoying it!', 'The Commons is great, especially now that they are accommodating to more types of diets and dietary restrictions. After two semesters of living on campus and basically living off of The Commons it can get just a tad repetitive, but its still very satisfying!', 'Dorm life at KSU is truly great! They have some of THE BEST dorms in GA. Rooms are great size, clean and the whole experience is fun and new!', ""Kennesaw is a very good school, that comes with a great higher education, but that means you are going to have to work. You'll have your free time but expect to slack off like high school. Every grade is very important and can change your whole experience in a class. Study!"", ""1) Do not plan your schedule for socializing. You are at school for education, and though college is a fun time in your life, take it from some one who knows how much focusing more on your social life than classes can screw you over, that you really need to create a schedule is best for you education, first. 2) If a teacher allows extra credit, do it! Always, even if you don't think you need it. Believe me you will always benefit. 3) Take advantage of study groups and tutoring supplied on your campus. Tutoring can get very expensive, but if your school has free tutoring (which KSU does), then definitely take advantage of that! 4) Buy your books used not from your school, and at sell back time your school will usually still buy them back from you even if you bought them else where. Books purchased from campus are most of the time more expensive and you might be able to get a few extra bucks back at sell back time! 5) Research your professors before class registration and have a list AND alternate possibilities ready. And then take full advantage of drop/add. It will be you best friend those first two weeks of classes."", 'Kennesaw State University is a truly welcoming school.

All types of students fit in great here. There is a good bit of homework, but it's mostly online with help on the problems. So it's not too terribly bad. Tips for prospective students The best thing to do would be to live on campus and get the unlimited meal plan. This makes everything very easy for a freshmen, plus it saves a lot of money. Also, it'd be great to bring a bike. It is a rather large campus. Bang for the buck The school has a relatively low tuition cost and great pricing for dorms. These dorms can be on the cheap side or on the expensive side. Even the cheap ones, I live in the cheapest dorms, are amazing. They are just like an apartment.

They take every report seriously. I have never even once begun to feel unsafe on campus. Also, ask anyone from the class of 2017 about the fire alarms in the University Village Suites. Let's just say there's no way there will ever be a fire that all of the Suites doesn't know about.., 21474=Tuition cost is, by far, the best thing about Kennesaw State University. The low In-state tuition has allowed me to take my core classes at a very acceptable and reasonable price. The campus is beautiful and the new dining hall is very deserving of appraisal. The services on campus are excellent for the cost of attending, and the price is perfect for the quality of education received. I'm sure we will see tuition costs rise dramatically very soon, as the introduction of a football team in 2014 will be spark some increased interest in this tuition state-wide, and possibly even nation-wide., 607735=There isn't going to be a football team until Fall 2015 but there's still Homecoming. They have a Intramural Flag Football game instead.}",,

It caters to the ultra-studious, to the laid-back student more keen on extracurricular activity. The atmosphere is comfortable and makes people feel at home and at ease. I would recommend the university to anyone and everyone."", ""Try not to get caught up so much in the partying scene. It's fine to have a good time, but remember you are paying a lot of money to attend college and you should make the most of your experience. Don't skip classes no matter how tired you are. If you don't show up to class, you won't do well. You absorb more than you think by just going to the class. I've learned this the hard way. Also, when selecting a room, be aware that air conditioned rooms cost $40 more per quarter. It is also cheaper to be in a double than a single. Also, realize that an umbrella and rain boots/snow boots are essential in navigating this puddle-prone campus. Finally, go into it with an open mind about the people you will meet. There will be many people from different backgrounds and upbringings than you and it's a great experience learning about different people and their cultures."", ""The reason why Ohio University gets three stars for this section is because for a public school, it is a bit more expensive than comparable schools like Ohio State University or the University of Cincinnati would be. I've visited both OSU and UC and the food at both universities exceeds the food at Ohio University. Ohio State University in particular has a good swipe system where students can swipe for just about any kind of food he or she desires. Ohio University is more limited in its food selections and the meal plans are expensive. It also should be noted that a student must live on campus for two years at Ohio University and must have a meal plan during that time."", ""I absolutely love being at Ohio University. The school gets a bad reputation for being a party school and I was a bit nervous about that going in, but I have since learned that the school is what you make of it. Sure, it does have a prominent party scene, but it also offers a lot of other extracurricular activities. Some of these activities include Baker movie nights (free movies shown in Baker Center for students), productions/performances/plays (admission is free with student ID), craft nights, dances, sports (Ping recreation center is new and free for students), etc. My favorite part about Ohio University and also one of the main reasons why I decided to attend, is the campus. It is the most beautiful campus I have seen (and trust me, I've visited and seen a lot.) There are many trees, flowers, fields, and animals around campus that make it have a natural and peaceful feel. The squirrel population is enormous and they are extremely friendly. There are also a lot of practice fields, benches and open space where students can gather to play sports, games, tan, read, study, etc."", 'I learned a lot during my first year at Ohio University. However, most of what I learned came from being outside of class because the classes themselves just serve to introduce and provide overviews of the courses.

I've visited both OSU and UC and the food at both universities exceeds the food at Ohio University. Ohio State University in particular has a good swipe system where students can swipe for just about any kind of food he or she desires. Ohio University is more limited in its food selections and the meal plans are expensive. It also should be noted that a student must live on campus for two years at Ohio University and must have a meal plan during that time. Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being at Ohio University. The school gets a bad reputation for being a party school and I was a bit nervous about that going in, but I have since learned that the school is what you make of it. Sure, it does have a prominent party scene, but it also offers a lot of other extracurricular activities.

The student population here is very diverse, but this just adds to all the cool people you can meet. Also, make sure you spend your time wisely - don't forget about studying! There are a lot of things that will distract you from your work, so make sure you get that done and you'll find you have a ton of time to spend doing other, fun things."", ""Ohio University has an average price- a little over $20,000 for tuition, fees, housing, and dining expenses. I don't think this is a bad price at all, considering how much I've learned, the good friends I've met, and all of the wonderful times I have had thus far in my college career, especially when I see how much private schools cost. I honestly would like it to be a little less, but that's only because I'm a broke college student paying my own way through.

For one, the campus is absolutely beautiful. There are so many flowers, plants, and trees. There are even two little lakes on campus, one with a waterfall, benches and a path around it. We also have a very scenic bike path that winds all through Athens and into other towns. Even the buildings are pretty, as most are made of brick. On one of the dorm greens there are basketball courts and sand volleyball. In addition, the campus is a good size- it takes only about 10 to 15 minutes to walk from one end of campus to the other. We have what we call uptown, also known as Court Street. It has a variety of little shops, bookstores, coffee shops, restaurants and bars you can go to and spend time with friends. If you get bored of being on campus, there is a state park (Strouds Run) a few minutes driving distance away with hiking trails, grills, and a beach. There are sporting events happening year round as well. If you don't care for sports but still want to workout we have an excellent recreation center called Ping- it even has a two story rock wall! There is always something you can be doing, as long as you try to find out what's going on. I love my school."", 'How much you learn is directly related to how much you put into it.

I've visited both OSU and UC and the food at both universities exceeds the food at Ohio University. Ohio State University in particular has a good swipe system where students can swipe for just about any kind of food he or she desires. Ohio University is more limited in its food selections and the meal plans are expensive. It also should be noted that a student must live on campus for two years at Ohio University and must have a meal plan during that time. Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being at Ohio University. The school gets a bad reputation for being a party school and I was a bit nervous about that going in, but I have since learned that the school is what you make of it. Sure, it does have a prominent party scene, but it also offers a lot of other extracurricular activities.

There are so many groups, clubs, and other students here, that anyone can find what they are looking for. Tips for prospective students For those of you thinking of coming here to OU here are a few tips: 1. GO TO CLASS. This is probably the most important thing to do because, now that we are on our own, we have many distractions and fun things to do. However, you are here to get an education and the best way to do that is going to class. 2. Study: To do well on test and exams, do your work and study so that you will be prepared. Also by study you will most likely get better grades, making your parents happy and keeping you off academic probation. Bang for the buck Personally I believe Ohio University is expensive, especially for out of state students. From what me and my friends have learned from this past year, OU will try and take as much of your money as possible whenever they have the chance. With this said, OU will give you many opportunities and connections to help further your career. Also you will have a great quality education.

Don't be afraid to get involved. If you see a sign for something that interests you, just go! Don't worry about going with someone else because you always meet new people.

Everyone's mom has told them the golden rule- do onto others as they do onto you. If you come to college being respectful to other people, their stuff and where you live- it will be a smooth experience."", ""Of course college is expensive. Its always going to be, and you can't get around it. You have housing, books, meal plans, classes, etc. For housing, OU has different prices for different residential halls, since some are renovated, some are mod style and some are traditional. There are also different pricing for singles, doubles, triples and quads. For books, you need to buy them at local bookstores, but what is nice is that some let you rent books at low cost. Also at the end of quarters OU has a book-exchange site, and a facebook page where students post books they are selling or trading or whatever. Every meal plan is at a different price, depending on which one suites you. When you are registering for classes, the registrar shows you extra costs (if any) that a specific class has. I like OU because even though it is expensive like any other college, you have options, which is why I choose 4 stars."", ""I was going to a community college and absolutely hated it. When I transferred to OU, I was amazed. The atmosphere has a homey feeling, is friendly and no, its not all about the partying.

If you get stuck in a class where the teacher just sucks at explaining the material or you just are not learning much, OU has so many more ways to learn the material for that specific class. OU provides SI, (supplement instruction) which are students that have taken the class before. The SI's go to every class as you go, and hold classes (usually in the evenings) for a student to ask questions, go over homework, and simply just help! Best part is its free!

There are so many groups, clubs, and other students here, that anyone can find what they are looking for. Tips for prospective students For those of you thinking of coming here to OU here are a few tips: 1. GO TO CLASS. This is probably the most important thing to do because, now that we are on our own, we have many distractions and fun things to do. However, you are here to get an education and the best way to do that is going to class. 2. Study: To do well on test and exams, do your work and study so that you will be prepared. Also by study you will most likely get better grades, making your parents happy and keeping you off academic probation. Bang for the buck Personally I believe Ohio University is expensive, especially for out of state students. From what me and my friends have learned from this past year, OU will try and take as much of your money as possible whenever they have the chance. With this said, OU will give you many opportunities and connections to help further your career. Also you will have a great quality education.

I've visited both OSU and UC and the food at both universities exceeds the food at Ohio University. Ohio State University in particular has a good swipe system where students can swipe for just about any kind of food he or she desires. Ohio University is more limited in its food selections and the meal plans are expensive. It also should be noted that a student must live on campus for two years at Ohio University and must have a meal plan during that time.

The school gets a bad reputation for being a party school and I was a bit nervous about that going in, but I have since learned that the school is what you make of it. Sure, it does have a prominent party scene, but it also offers a lot of other extracurricular activities. Some of these activities include Baker movie nights (free movies shown in Baker Center for students), productions/performances/plays (admission is free with student ID), craft nights, dances, sports (Ping recreation center is new and free for students), etc. My favorite part about Ohio University and also one of the main reasons why I decided to attend, is the campus. It is the most beautiful campus I have seen (and trust me, I've visited and seen a lot.) There are many trees, flowers, fields, and animals around campus that make it have a natural and peaceful feel. The squirrel population is enormous and they are extremely friendly. There are also a lot of practice fields, benches and open space where students can gather to play sports, games, tan, read, study, etc. Am learning a lot I learned a lot during my first year at Ohio University.

The population grows by over 5x for that weekend with a huge block party on court street. The city allows bands to play on multiple stages on court street through the night. I highly recommend googleing about it. Everyone participates in a shuffle at some point or another. A shuffle is basically a themed bar crawl where a group of people will go to each bar and typically have that bar's drink or shot that they are known for. Usually the shufflers wear some type of unique/matching outfits to match their theme. You write on the bathroom walls to document your shuffle. It is always entertaining reading the posts while going to the bathroom at the bars. Homecoming is always a fun weekend where kegs and eggs begin at 5-6AM."", 'Costs are pretty much the same across Ohio except off-campus rent in Athens is a lot more than other college campuses because of supply and demand and the isolated location. There are a lot of unique spending options in athens though such as their Farmers Market held year round to buy fresh meat and produce.', 'The university offers a lot of events, but most students partake their evenings/weekends at house parties or at the bars on Court Street. There are 20 bars that are within walking distance of all of on and off campus living. In the spring time there are fests which are basically huge block parties on different streets each saturday. The fests get pretty rowdy.', ""When I lived in the dorms the dining halls weren't the greatest. We really only had one really nice dining hall and it wasn't open on weekends. Now though, two are newly remodeled and they are going to be remodeling the others too. The food at Baker Center (our student union) is really nice, and there are three on-campus coffee shops spread out across campus. If you don't have time to sit down to eat there are grab-and-go options too that are open more extended hours. There are markets too but they are over-priced you would be better going to an actual grocery store."", 'They have plans to be building 10+ new dorms where current building exist over the next several years so I am sure they will be nicer than the current ones. At Ohio University you have to live in the dorms your first two years of college. You can live in a single up to a quad. The layouts vary and there are three different dorm communities called greens (South, East, & West Green). All are close to classes and dining halls.', ""I am sure the academic rigor varies by major. I am double majoring in Accounting and Business-Pre Law. The accounting program is very rigorous, but is worth it when it comes to job placement and the CPA exam.

Tips for prospective students For those of you thinking of coming here to OU here are a few tips: 1. GO TO CLASS. This is probably the most important thing to do because, now that we are on our own, we have many distractions and fun things to do. However, you are here to get an education and the best way to do that is going to class. 2. Study: To do well on test and exams, do your work and study so that you will be prepared. Also by study you will most likely get better grades, making your parents happy and keeping you off academic probation. Bang for the buck Personally I believe Ohio University is expensive, especially for out of state students. From what me and my friends have learned from this past year, OU will try and take as much of your money as possible whenever they have the chance.

There are so many groups, clubs, and other students here, that anyone can find what they are looking for. Tips for prospective students For those of you thinking of coming here to OU here are a few tips: 1. GO TO CLASS. This is probably the most important thing to do because, now that we are on our own, we have many distractions and fun things to do. However, you are here to get an education and the best way to do that is going to class. 2. Study: To do well on test and exams, do your work and study so that you will be prepared. Also by study you will most likely get better grades, making your parents happy and keeping you off academic probation.

The only thing I disagree with is that they kind of suck your money out of you when you're here. In the Nelson Market for example, everything is basically three times the price of what it would be elsewhere, and there are huge flat screen tvs that project stupid things like the hours a store is open, etc. As far as education goes though, five stars."", ""If you're into the Greek life, join that. If not, join anything else you can. There are tons of organizations for every sport and hobby, just get out there. Also, there's a great bike path for when its warm, there are plays and concerts in the auditorium which are often free for students, there are cafes and restaurants up town.. there's a decent amount of stuff to do here for Athens being the size it is."", ""There are four dining halls on campus, all of which are very different from each other. So, there's a decent variety in food choices. Obviously, eating at the dining halls all the time, you kind of get sick of it and because its all mass produced food its generally somewhat flavorless. The only serious complaint I have is the lack of real fruits and vegetables. The mass produced stuff isn't even edible sometimes, like rock hard apples etc. But overall its okay."", ""Dorm life varies a lot. Personally, my dorm (on South Green) isn't fancy but it's functional. It's pretty plain and generic but its clean, its a friendly environment, close to the dining halls, and you'll never get fat living here because you walk up hill to go everywhere. Overall, it's been a positive experience so far."", ""This really depends on how into academics you are. OU has a rep for being a party school so a lot of people here (stupidly) blow off classes and assignments. BUT the faculty is incredible. They really know their stuff, and all of the professors I've had have been really passionate not only about their subjects, but about teaching too. They really want you to succeed. Basially, you get out what you put in."", ""GET INVOLVED. It's a common phrase, but its seriously important. If you don't get out of your shell and join a club or activity or something like that then it's going to be hard to make friends. Also, don't get carried away with the partying and all that. Yes, there are parties. But if you don't go looking for them, and make stupid decisions at them, then they won't affect you too much."", ""Ohio University is a beautiful, if hilly, campus. It's faculty is passionate, kind, and intelligent, and classes are fulfilling for those who really want to learn.

There are two police stations located on campus and each are a short distance away and an officer will respond in a hurry.

There is also a campus wide alert system that alerts every student via text and e-mail if there is ever an emergency.', ""Greek life is a large part of the campus, so large it pretty much has it's own street! Almost all of the Greek Houses are located on one street and they are located uptown so your'e a step away from the restaurants and everything Athens has to offer. An annual tradition at OU is Greek Week, in which all of the new recruits are welcomed. The week ends in each Fraternity and Sorority picking their own song and dancing to it, in a public showing, in the challenge of air bands."", ""Ohio University has a club for almost everything from academic to sports. If they don't have the club or organization you wanted to join then all you have to do is request to start your own club. WIth so many students on campus you will be hard pressed not to find other students who don't have similar interests as you do. There is so many things to do around campus you will always be active and if you want to find something to do you won't have to go far."", ""This university is great for students who aren't afraid to be themselves and maybe take some chances sometimes to step out of their box. Ohio University is very diverse and this is the opportunity to meet people you otherwise would have never met. For example a Chinese Student lives across the hall from me last year and he would give me things such as Chinese Tea and good luck charms in exchange to learn more English and help him get around campus. It is memories like that one that will stick with me for the rest of my life and I hope more students will get the chance to have the same feeling."", ""I truly could not think of a better place to have my college career. Going into my senior year I like back and think about all of the great memories and all of the friends I have made here. In the Summer I cannot wait to head back to school but when Spring Break rolls around I'm dreading that I have to leave soon. I mean just name another university who has a Vice President who does the duggie for incoming Freshmen at orientation. Even though the student body is large in number there is never a time I haven't felt like part of a close knit family here."", ""Even though Ohio University has been ranked one of the top party school for several years now there are many other options to have fun. Athens has movie theater and several restaurants to eat at if you're in the mood for a nice dinner out. If you're looking for things to do on campus you will be guaranteed to see students covering the green spaces on campus playing frisbee, sand volleyball, tossing the football out, or just laying out. There are several club and intramural teams (competitive and non competitive) to join with a few friends. A brand new recreational center overlooks the entrance of campus and it's a great place to join workout classes or just shoot the basketball with some friends. Along with these activities the Ohio University Campus includes an Olympic sized swimming pool, it's own golf course/driving range, bike trails, and a ice skating rink. If you are in the mood to watch a sporting event there are few better places to catch a football or basketball game."", ""Dining options are located all over campus (no further than a short walk) and each has recently been renovated. The hours of operation are spread all throughout the day so that one dining hall is almost guaranteed to be open. Not in the mood to sit down and eat? No problem because grad and go options along with carry out options are always available. Don't feel like eating dining hall food again? Once again no problem because there are several restaurants located in the uptown part of Athens and it is a short walk from anywhere on campus."", ""Ohio University is filled with tradition rich Resident's Halls (not dorms). Each building is unique in it's own way and it allows for students to be close and social. The resident's halls are all within a five minutes walk to campus and the recreational center isn't far off. As part of the staff in residential housing I take great pride in providing a comfortable place for students to live."", 'There is a great balance at Ohio University between having fun and academic life.

Baker Theater shows movies that recently came out for free. The school of theater produces very good shows as well as school of dance and school of music. The ice skating rink is free for all students, but it's $3 if you need to rent the ice skates. All the football games are also free for students, and majority of campus goes there to see the great Marching 110. The country side is beautiful, if you can get a ride to Old Man's Cave and take the trail there, it's so gorgeous. Besides the many many many on campus events, there are of course 33 bars in town, Halloween party, and all the fests."", ""We have excellent food. There is so much choice. I work at Shively Court- you can get anything from mexican style food, fast food, full salad bar, pizzas, subway sandwich, soups, homestyle, to ice cream. And if that doesn't do for you, there are other dining halls like Nelson that offer wok, and all day breakfast option, etc. There's always a vegan option, and all the dining halls are all you can eat style."", ""I lived in James Hall, Brough House, and Voigt Hall. The rooms themselves are really old, you don't have the power over the heater since it's controlled by a central facility- so there will be those odd days that are suddenly freezing when it was 70F the day before, but central facility won't turn the heater on until they know it will be freezing for a while. For James and Voigt the doubles were fine, the RAs are cool and there were a lot of events that they organized. Movie nights, BBQ, board games, organized trips/hikes etc. Cool way to meet your neighbors besides seeing them in the bathrooms. Brough House- The single rooms there- you can literally hear everything through those cardboard walls, which may become very awkward at times. The room is also unbelievably small. If you're able to get a renovated dorm such as Adams or Biddle, they are much much much nicer."", 'Students are expected to do their work well. The professors have office hours and very good about answering emails if students have any questions. There are a lot of resources if a student feels they need help. Campus judiciary is not forgiving if a student has been caught underage drinking or accused of rape. Most likely the student will be on a probation or expelled, respectively.', ""There is indeed a very active social scene, the students who tend to drop out or do poorly are ones who do not show up to class and/or spend their entire time partying. The best tip for any college is to learn how to manage your time well and get involved with school organizations and events. There a lot of very well-respected guest speakers who come to campus, college of fine arts has so many student concerts and shows that are amazing. There's always something going on."", ""It's a great school in a beautiful campus. The professors are very approachable and it's easy to meet with them for office hours.

Greek Life allows students to make lifelong friendships and connections as well as improving leadership and social skills. One thing I learned from experience is this- introduce yourself to your professors and communicate with them. Communication allows professors to see that you are interested and engaged with the course and that you want to succeed. Most importantly of all, do not be afraid to ask for help.

The school gets a bad reputation for being a party school and I was a bit nervous about that going in, but I have since learned that the school is what you make of it. Sure, it does have a prominent party scene, but it also offers a lot of other extracurricular activities. Some of these activities include Baker movie nights (free movies shown in Baker Center for students), productions/performances/plays (admission is free with student ID), craft nights, dances, sports (Ping recreation center is new and free for students), etc. My favorite part about Ohio University and also one of the main reasons why I decided to attend, is the campus. It is the most beautiful campus I have seen (and trust me, I've visited and seen a lot.) There are many trees, flowers, fields, and animals around campus that make it have a natural and peaceful feel. The squirrel population is enormous and they are extremely friendly. There are also a lot of practice fields, benches and open space where students can gather to play sports, games, tan, read, study, etc. Am learning a lot I learned a lot during my first year at Ohio University.

I've visited both OSU and UC and the food at both universities exceeds the food at Ohio University. Ohio State University in particular has a good swipe system where students can swipe for just about any kind of food he or she desires. Ohio University is more limited in its food selections and the meal plans are expensive. It also should be noted that a student must live on campus for two years at Ohio University and must have a meal plan during that time. Am enjoying being here I absolutely love being at Ohio University. The school gets a bad reputation for being a party school and I was a bit nervous about that going in, but I have since learned that the school is what you make of it. Sure, it does have a prominent party scene, but it also offers a lot of other extracurricular activities.

I also spend lots of time in the Multicultural Center (MCC) which is a place for students to go and study and we also host events there such as holiday parties.

Because it's so large, the campus is divided into the Greens; North, South, East and West Green. I lived on South Green which is the furthest from most of campus but it is the most quiet. It is also closest to the major dining halls so I appreciated that. South Green had mod style living which I thought was different, but I liked it. I personally lived in a gender-neutral mod so men and women could room together. It was made up of LGBT students and it was very comfortable. My only complaint was laundry. Students pay for mostly everything on campus so I expected free laundry but that wasn't the case.

It is a large campus and finding your way around can get quite confusing. I'd even encourage prospects to visit more than once. My second tip would be to research about the different organizations on campus online before attending. In the beginning of the fall semester we have what we call the Involvement Fair which is an event held outside on the College Green. Each organization sets up a table for students to come and learn about the organization. With so many students and so much going on it can be quite overwhelming. So I would recommend looking at a few things the student might be interested in online so that when the time comes and the student is at the fair, they'd already know which tables to go to!"", ""I transferred to OU from Marietta College and I believe it was one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

Also, attend class because that's what will help you learn the most!""]]",University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Wisconsin-Oshkosh/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/78912,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,5,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00076-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,909112071,909052650,HORIZONTAL,"10/26/2010 Reviewer is A current student here. 9 out of 9 people found this review useful. 1 of 63 Lindsey from Lomira, WI Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

It's really fun to get to know everyone because you'll be living in such tight quarters for a year. Also, stay active and be involved on campus. There are many ways you can meet people and have fun. I joined a soccer intermural team and it was so fun to meet new people and try something new."", ""Overall, the campus is really worth the money you pay. The only thing that I dislike about the money aspect of this college is that the food selection isn't worth the $1,200 you pay a semester. Some examples are: at one of the food locations (Reeve Memorial and Mi Taza) one single hard boiled egg is considered a side, which to me is ridiculous because another side could be chips, frys, mashed potatoes. Also, at Reeve Memorial, they are very picky at what you can add on to your meal. For example, at Titan Tacos, if you didn't want tomatos but wanted to add sour cream, they won't let you unless they charge you extra. Or on a burrito if you wanted beans instead of rice they won't allow that either. I feel that if I'm paying $1,200 a semester for food, I should be able to get what I want and where I want."", 'I LOVE going to school at Oshkosh. This school has many things available to keep anyone busy. From tons of intermural sports, to regular season sports, to frats and sorority and many educational clubs. One of my favorite things to do during my free time is work at at the rec center. This rec center is newly built and is huge! There is indoor basketball courts, indoor and outdoor volleyball courts, a full track, 2 studios that offer free exercise classes (which are really fun!) and a variety of exercise machines!', ""This campus has a variety of ways to help you succeed in the classroom. First off, there are a mixture of big pit lecture halls or small size classes. If you're accepted into the UW-Honors program you're class sizes are no larger than 15 kids. Also, there are many posters hung up around school offering tutors. For me math has always been a struggle but the free math lab has tutors who are there especially for your individual math class. The teachers are always willing to help you or ask questions if you need to.

There are also safety measures put into place to provide you with safety 24/7. If you ever feel unsafe walking at night you can press a blue button located all across campus and a campus safety officer will walk with you to whatever location you need to get to, any time of day. You can also sign up to get alerts on your phone if there is going to be dangerous weather, so you have a heads up on potentially dangerous conditions.', ""There are five different sororities and five fraternities at UW Oshkosh.

The dorms may be a bit overpriced for such a small room, but living on campus is very convenient. All of the residence halls are very close to all of the academic buildings and it's easy to participate in events later in the evenings because you can just walk over. The food is pretty well worth the cost as you don't have to prepare any of your own food and it covers the entire semester. The tuition is definitely worth the cost as the classes are great and the professors are very accommodating.

The rooms are small, but you can rearrange your room however you would like which gives you new perspectives and a nice change up mid-semester. The dorms are included with dressers, closets, microwave, fridge, shelves, and a mirror. This is especially nice so you don't have to worry about purchasing these things before moving in. The hall community is also very nice. I haven't had any problems with anyone in my hall and everyone seems very friendly. The CA's are also very open and friendly and will help you with any problem you may have. The one downside is sharing a community bathroom, but you get used to it. The bathrooms are always clean as janitors clean them every morning and surprisingly aren't too crowded in the mornings."", ""Depending on the class and the professor, the material can be very challenging to relatively easy. Some professors test on small details from the textbooks while others test on the main ideas and concepts of the chapter.

They have many jobs, workshops, clubs, organizations, recreational activities, fun events, and ways to plug in, you just have to be willing to grab a friend (or go solo) and try as much as you can, as soon as you can. Those who do not get involved right away often get caught up in the idea that UWO is boring and end up at the local bars. My advice to you? Jump into college with both feet as soon as you get there- first week of your freshman semester- like I did, and you'll soon feel at home."", 'With a plethora of student organizations and on-campus opportunities, UWO has all the offerings of a large state university. They offer everything from cheap bus rides to Chicago, extensive study abroad trip options, affordable or free recreational rentals, fun and free events on campus at least 4 nights a week, on and off campus job fairs, free training and workshops for countless job search techniques, the list goes on and on!

Anybody interested in social change, whether youÃ¢\x80\x99re gaga for politics or love volunteering, will find excellent ways to get involved either on campus or off. Western students have endless enthusiasm for campus, community, and world issues with good reasonÃ¢\x80\x94only the proactive and self-motivated survive here. Lovers of all things indie will find a thriving local music scene and great (and cheap) concerts at Western and in Seattle.', 'Invest in a pair of rain boots and a high quality jacket. When you have to walk through the lake that was once Red Square, youÃ¢\x80\x99ll thank me! Go to Info Fair before classes start in the fall. Not only will you get more detail on opportunities, but you can win gear, get some grub, and will never have to buy a pen (ever). If you enjoy reading the newspaper, grab a free copy of The New York Times by the library before you head to class. Attend at least one Open Mike Night on a Tuesday in the Underground Coffee House for laughs and lyrics. Study tip: If youÃ¢\x80\x99re looking for a reliable computer to work on, then make the trek to the 3rd floor of the Academic Instructional Center. Library and other academic building labs tend to be full or faulty, but these labs are the most recently constructed. Going to a school wondering Ã¢\x80\x98what will this school do for me?Ã¢\x80\x99 is not nearly as productive and engaging as Ã¢\x80\x98what can I do for this school?Ã¢\x80\x99 Produce real change at Western by serving on a committee, council, or the Student Senate, or by attending a forum. Western tries to put as many students as possible in jobs and positions that affect how the school is run. You make this school as prestigious, accommodating, and fun as you want it to be. IÃ¢\x80\x99ve presented a lot of options, but really the depth, not the breadth of what you pursue on campus determines whether or not you have a fulfilling experience. Invest in whatever gets you truly excited.', 'If you choose your professors wisely, enroll for up to 18 credits (it costs the same as less credits), use the resources that your tuition fees cover, and buy used textbooks, then youÃ¢\x80\x99re getting a great deal. Tuition prices are very reasonable, but increasing, and so the best way to get the biggest bang for your buck is to get involved and use all of the resources. The Scholarship Center, Technology Center, Writing Center, Student Employment Office, and Viking Union are excellent places to start. Plenty of events on campus offer free food, music, film, art, lectures, prizes, gamesÃ¢\x80\x94you name it. Facebook and the Viking Union will keep you posted on all the happenings. When you buy textbooks, check out the coupon booklet they give you at the register thatÃ¢\x80\x99s loaded with discounts. Also, take advantage of free PE classes during the first week of every term since itÃ¢\x80\x99s a great way to vary your workout and meet new people. Western constantly strives to better their campus community and the university experience through their resources. Even with budget cuts, WWU looks for ways to offer their students uncompromised, high quality education. Learning isnÃ¢\x80\x99t just about listening to a lecture, or writing down notes, but doing. Do everything you can to succeed and you will.', 'Walking through Red Square between classes, youÃ¢\x80\x99ll see booths for activities, clubs, and causes along with random student stunts and skits. Red Square is like the living room of WWU and reflects the quirky, energetic students that call WWU home. Since WWUÃ¢\x80\x99s enrollment is midsized (around 13,000), you will not feel lost among swarms of people and will have plenty of opportunities to get involved in student leadership that might not be presented at other, larger universities. Although you donÃ¢\x80\x99t get the Ã¢\x80\x9cbig schoolÃ¢\x80? sports craze, most students here are very athletic, and so youÃ¢\x80\x99re more likely to play sports than watch them here (intramurals). The Recreation Center is a great facility and I would highly encourage working out regularly. My days at Western are full, active, enjoyable days. Everything I learn inside and outside the classroom makes me glad to be here. Not to mention, Bellingham is a beautiful city with entertainment and personality thatÃ¢\x80\x99s only 90 minutes from the bustling Seattle scene or Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'WWUÃ¢\x80\x99s faculty can be characterized as innovative, challenging, and accommodating. Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. TheyÃ¢\x80\x99re accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers. If you ever struggle, your peers at the Tutoring Center will be right there with you to sort out whatever complicated idea youÃ¢\x80\x99re trying to wrap your brain around.']]",Western Washington University (Western) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Washington-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/89865,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,1,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00076-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,909251335,909112866,HORIZONTAL,"07/29/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 33 out of 33 people found this review useful. 1 of 138 Patricia from Brush Prairie, WA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Almost all professors encourage you to come and speak with them outside of class if you have any questions ranging from you are confused to you believe what they are saying can be challenged. I recommend talking to previous students and using rate my professor when picking what classes you enroll in because it does make a huge difference.

That being said, I must also let you know that I spend most of my money on important stuff like food, and I cut most other expenses."", ""Bellingham is absolutely beautiful. The view from the Viking Commons dining hall is breathtaking. The entire campus is paved in brick and it lies in the middle of a forest. The atmosphere is friendly and trusting, and everyone's willing to help one another out. Vikings ride bicycles and longboards and wear woolen sweaters and moccasins. We're pretty much in British Columbia, so be prepared for cold winters :) The professors and administrators are patient and know what they're talking about. George Mariz, the head of the honors program, is a sweet guy and an excellent instructor. He is the advisor for honors students, so if you have any questions just Google him and you can find his contact info!"", ""If you're looking into Western's Honor's Program, this review will probably be helpful for you! If not, you might still get something out of it :) My name's Hannah and I'm working towards multiple degrees in neuroscience and biology, chemistry, biochemistry, or psychology. Let me start this by saying that I was blown away at the difference between high school and this university. The professors here care so much more than my previous instructors. If you don't understand something and you need extra help, they will go out of their ways just to make it clearer for you. The learning isn't just text book based, either. My life experience has grown tremendously since I started going to classes here. Western is all about being green. No, I mean really. Other institutions say that they're green, but they ain't got nothin' on Western! Throwing away recyclable stuff is pretty much a sin here. Classes for honors students cap at about 25 students, so the likelihood of being overlooked is minimized. Even in non-honors classes and lectures, there are fewer students than in other, larger universities. I do have one course with about 400 students, but it's an elective course. Also, I feel over 9,000X more educated since I arrived here.""]]",Western Washington University (Western) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Washington-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/89865,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,5,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00076-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,909251335,909112866,HORIZONTAL,"07/29/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 33 out of 33 people found this review useful. 1 of 138 Patricia from Brush Prairie, WA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Once you get into your discipline though class sizes drop dramatically and most students are able to receive some great one on one experience.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers.

Bellingham is a lovely town with lots of things to do and places to explore and the people here are amazing.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor.

For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment.

For those who are less eco-focused, such as myself, if you at least have an appreciation for nature or the arts, there's plenty to be had on campus."", ""Plan what classes to take during the year ahead of time when at all possible. This makes it a lot easier to see what needs to be done for your major/minor. Take a reasonable course load, not just the easy, low credit classes. A mix of difficult and easy will make the quarter easier on you and allow greater progress. This is college, expect to work hard but don't kill yourself over studies and stress. A big key part of succeeding in college is taking care of your overall health. This may sound like your mother, but she has a good point. If you do not take care of your body, you cannot perform well, and trust me, having mono during finals week is hellish. You take the extra time to give your body what it needs and you won't have two weeks of your quarter destroyed due to whatever illness is cycling through campus."", ""There are excellent teachers on campus, ones who can make a business law class seem like the most exciting thing in the world or break a complex equation down into understandable parts you can remember during tests. Taking as many credits as you can handle, from 12-18, is always good as this range has the same price. If the prospect of 18 credits is daunting, try A) taking classes in subject you know you are good at, B) Intro classes that are required for various GURs or C) taking a PE class or two to help you manage stress levels. Living off campus is highly recommended, and much more affordable, particularly Birnam Wood Apartments.There are convenient bus systems all through Bellingham that make it easy to survive without a car, also good if you live off campus. Keep in mind that if you do want to live on campus for the social aspect, you are required to get a meal plan, which depending on what you get can be more expensive then the dorm itself. If you're the outdoors type, there are many inexpensive activities you can enjoy through the Outdoor Center to keep you active and healthy. Getting used books or using the textbooks in the library can also help lower costs considerably. I've survived two quarters by borrowing half my books from friends and then helping them sell the books after I was finished. You can find good deals for books in the WWU forum, where students post books they are trying to get rid of as well as the books they are looking for."", ""I absolutely love walking around campus. Red Square is a hub of activity on sunny days and the first few weeks of each quarter. Often populated with booths offering information about services and clubs or free food (love the coffee booth at 10 am). Students gather and laze in the sun with friends or show off new tricks. In the late afternoon, Red Square is popular for the skateboarders on campus to cruise around without worrying about running into crowds. The campus itself is beautiful, with lots of open grass areas, wooded regions, and a wonderful view of the bay from the PAC square (another great sunbathing place). Along with it's beauty, the walk from one side of campus to the other is about 10 minutes, convenient when you have classes in different buildings. The general atmosphere of WWU is very laid back and open, allowing students the opportunity to explore new ideas academically and socially in a"", ""You learn only so much as you will allow yourself to explore new subjects and grow, and WWU is great for that. There are excellent teachers, multiple tutor centers, and a number of useful resource offices found in the Viking Union and Old Main. For when I need to blow off steam, the Rec Center is fully equipped, and also offers various classes and sports teams one can get involved in. Sometimes tutors or exercise are more distracting then productive, so I find that a quiet place in the library (there are many, be careful to not get lost) or taking over a classroom with a study group in the evening can really help get some serious studying done, as well as have questions answered via my peers. Western allows me to both learn a great deal through classes and also how to learn outside class, a key survival skill both in college and in the real world. With all the resources at hand, WWU is very conductive to creating one's own effective study habits. Put in the effort, find your passion, and you will learn much more then you thought you could at this school.""]]",Western Washington University (Western) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Western-Washington-University/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/89865,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,26,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00076-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,909251335,909112866,HORIZONTAL,"07/29/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 33 out of 33 people found this review useful. 1 of 138 Patricia from Brush Prairie, WA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I am excited to be applying there.', 'Definitely start off talking with the professors at the beginning of the quarters. You are always told that in books and things, but I never listened to them until about mid-way through winter quarter. This made me realize that they are actually there to help you and want you to succeed in their classes! Especially when you are struggling, they always make time for you to come in and talk to them about what you are having problems with and help you through it, and they make it easy! If you cannot go during their office hours they will make you a special appointment. This is the number one tip I can give, and also do not put off studying for the tests. Go in before your first test to the tutoring center and go talk to the study skills people to help you get the best results on your tests for yourself.', 'I think you get a quality education from very quality professors for the price you are paying.

If you go to your classes I think the experiences and schooling is worth it. Education is a privilege, and not something to be taken lightly. Even with the rising tuition cost, I know western is one of the lower costing colleges in Washington, but even so, they are an excellent school, and really do have teachers that are willing to focus on their students.', 'Western is located in Bellingham. Bellingham is made for the outdoors person. Personally my favorite thing to do is to go exploring. there are several beaches and parks, walks, and hikes that you can do off campus. during spring quarter, my friends and I spend most of your time at Whatcom Lake. The clubhouse rents out canoes and kayaks for $3. especially if you have never been on the water, it is something that every college student should experience. If you are not into the outdoors so much, you can always go into Fairhaven (the town, not the dooms), and walks around town. Downtown bellingham and Fairhaven are great places to eat, my personal favorite being the Boundary Bay Brewery. If you want some activities on campus there is always the rec center; open to all western students. Also western offers a wide variety of clubs from Minecraft club to Spanish club. Also you can go into the Fairhaven doors and play pool and ping-pong. basically it is really hard to be bored in Bellingham.', ""The dining halls on western's campus are no exception to the freshman 15. The food is good for the first quarter, but after a while it all tastes the same. not in a bad way, but in a typical college dining hall way."", ""I lived in Fairhaven my freshman year of college and loved it. I met my best friends there and shared a great year with the people. Western also does a Viking launch program which I participated in. This program was held for 2 weeks in Fairhaven. The experience was exceptional. Also Fairhaven isn't set up like a normal dorm; rather like wings of a house. each floor had 5 suites, and each suite had 2-4 rooms attached by a bathroom. This layout gave the door a home-like attribute to living on campus. Sophomore year my friends and I moved to Birnam Wood; the on-campus apartments. Looking back this residency had less of the community feeling that Fairhaven had. The apartment style housing was good for second and third year students who have jobs and actually study."", 'College is not mystery. Go to class, pay attention, and learn how to effectively study. Certainly the upper level classes are more time demanding, but are just as passable as the lower 100 and 200 level classes.', ""The one thing that I had to learn the hard was was try and see an academic adviser at least once each year. especially if you are like me and am not sure of your major and change it several times. They keep things in perspective for you and also keep you on track. College is expensive and its good to keep on schedule so you are not there longer than you have to be. Ans my second tip is get to know your professors. They come in handy when you need help or recommendations for programs. but most of all, the best tip I can give is to go to all your classes. only miss a day if you have to. Last quarter I had a rough patch in my life and didn't want to get out of bed. As a result I missed a lot of class periods and my grades and GPA dipped because of it."", ""Western is a science and woodring program oriented school located in beautiful Bellingham. Western offers the college experience without Greek life.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely. WWU also has an excellent library with the Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) and Summit catalog as well as an extensive article database for writing papers. If you ever struggle, your peers at the Tutoring Center will be right there with you to sort out whatever complicated idea youÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to wrap your brain around.

Another tradition at Western is that during dead week, if you buy something on campus before noon, you get a receipt that gets you one dollar off of any drink you order after 2 pm.

Surrounded by mountains and forest, there is plenty of skiing, snowboarding, hiking, camping, and rock climbing to be found. The Arboretum is a giant hill right behind the campus with lots of trails and places to explore. Downtown Bellingham is a short walk from campus and has several shops and stores to check out.

There are also some great places around Western to just hang out with friends and play games.', ""Before actually getting to Western, I was a little nervous about the food. I'd heard some horror stories about the cafeteria food at some college campuses, and I didn't want a repeat of the trashy food in high school. I was thrilled to learn I had absolutely nothing to worry about. Western is affiliated with an organic and healthy foods distributor, and meals are fantastic! The main dining hall has four stations, two which offer something new and delicious every day, one for freshly made sandwiches, and one for pizza/hamburgers, etc. There is also a full time salad and fruit bar.

If dining halls aren't your thing, though, there are several cheap restaurants and stores very close to the campus that are popular among students."", ""Most people are really friendly, it's easy to jump in with a group you've never met and hang out. Floors hold all sorts of different activities, including decoration parties (for holidays), movie nights, and late night ice cream excursions. There are also dances and socials every month.

It has over 150 majors and minors, and every student is given an adviser to help plan schedules, give academic advice, or just chat. The majority of classes, even the required general courses, are under 50 students. Professors really care about students and go out of their way to be available for help. In addition to great academics, there are hundreds of clubs and extracurricular activities for students to partake in.

Fairhaven Commons are known to have the best food on campus and be the most acceptable to students who have food allergies and/or are gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian.

The Ridge is located up in the trees a little bit above campus and would be known as the party dorms. There are different types of dorms on the ridge. Beta and Gamma are suite-style dorms (4 rooms all sharing one bathroom) and Kappa, Omega, Sigma, and Highland Hall are all hall style dorms. Living on the ridge gives you a little bit of a workout because you have to walk up hills to get back to your room usually. North Campus consists of five dorms, Mathes, Nash, and Higginson, Edens Hall, and Edens North. Edens Hall is the honors dorms for students who are admitted for honors classes and all four of the other dorms are hall style. Those who live on North Campus are very close to campus and say they have a very close connection with everyone on their floor and everyone they live close too. Fairhaven is on south campus and completely immersed in trees and wilderness. It is a slightly far walk from campus but those who live there say they love it and most buildings are a mixture of hall style and suite-style dorms. Some refer to this part of campus as hippie.', 'Dependent on what classes you take, the difficulty level can vary. Most first year (level 100) classes will be fairly straightforward and easy to complete with a passing grade (C or higher). Also the difficulty of the classes depends on what type of class it is. A math class may be harder than an english class, while a history class may be easier than a science class. It also depends on what you like, if you enjoy math and science the struggle you may have to face passing those classes may be worth it. My advice is to take classes that look interesting to you and that ignite your curiosity.', ""Western Washington University is a relaxing environment with professors who want you to succeed.

Most every classroom is equipped with the technology to allow for multi-media presentations, so you will never have a talking head professor. The professors try to cater to every type of learner through these different mediums and apply what you learn to the real world. For me, this type of instruction included completing a project that will be used by Western faculty and affect the way they teach. You will never go hungry for knowledge with the fast paced and interactive classroom environment. Speaking up and speaking out in class is common, encouraged, and the best way to solidify class concepts. If you need help, want to talk more in-depth about a topic, just ask your professors. TheyÃ¢Â€Â™re accessible and very willing to work with you, provide feedback, or write letters of reference. Talk to students, scan www.ratemyprofessors.com and choose your professors wisely.

Even though you must learn to fend for yourself and are put up to the task to create a whole new routine to your new life, the dorm life at Western helps guide you tremendously along the way. The dorms are filled with wonderful people and not to mention the hygiene is maintained by the lovely janitors that clean twice a day.', 'Even though I am only a freshman at this school, and I have yet to complete two more quarters for this year, I have some good insight on the academic rigor of this school. The academic rigor at this school is challenging and broadening of the mind. The professors and grad students that teach the courses are very passionate about their subjects and care for the growth of the student body. Even if you are not trying to major in a certain subject class that you are taking, the professors and grad students make sure you understand the concepts in the class so that the student can take full advantage of the college expereince.', 'One thing that Western requires of you as a student as does most colleges, is some independence. Western is a school that contains all of the most important and vital resources, but the student must train themselves to utilize these resources and their independence in the most effective equilibirium to help them become successfull. This may sound like a bit of a struggle, but once you have figured out how to perform this task successfully, you feel your mind growing and creating synapses that you had no idea existed.', 'On a scale of one to ten I would rate Western Washington University a 8. The reason that this rating is a 8 and not 10, is because no college is absolutley perfect.

To build a spiral conductor, you create many blocks with different size properties and orientations and arrange them in the desired configuration. In the code, you need a couple of variables to keep track of: Parameterizing the cross section is easy to do there. The number of windings, on the other hand, cannot be parameterized in the COMSOL Desktop, because the length of a piece of wire changes every third turn. As you saw above, however, you can use the COMSOL API to specify all properties of a block in your JavaÃ‚Â® program. You can use that to build a spiral conductor geometry automatically. The aim of the model is to compute the self inductance for the given coil design. If you look at the geometry closely, you can see that it is built up from an arrangement of blocks. In the model, the dimensions of the spiral are fixed to particular values. When designing such a device, it is useful to look at different configurations, like inductors with different cross sections and number of windings, for instance. To this end, you can set up the geometry parametrically in the COMSOL Desktop. To illustrate an application of the COMSOL API, we can look at the model of a spiral inductor from our Model Gallery. Example: Building a Spiral Inductor geometry This is","You then generate the blocks that make up the spiral in a loop. As you now know, you need a unique tag to identify each block. You could create that yourself, by concatenating a block counter to a base string, such as ""blk"". The better alternative, however, is to use the uniquetag() method provided by the COMSOL API. This method does the same thing, but keeps track of counters internally and makes sure that a tag is not used twice. In the code snippet below, the tag for each block is generated with model.geom(""geom1"").feature().uniquetag(""blk"") With the new unique tag, you now create a block and set its properties. Aside from the ""size"", you also have to change the ""pos"" and ""rot"" properties for the position and orientation respectively. After that, you update the variables for the next iteration. A spiral inductor geometry is generated automatically with the COMSOL API for use with JavaÃ‚Â®. WhatÃ¢Â€Â™s Next? You can use the COMSOL API for many more things than creating geometries, of course. In fact, you can automate any modeling task you normally perform with the COMSOL Desktop. In the example of the spiral inductor, you could, for instance, continue to compute the new result of the updated geometry. You could also run a parametric sweep in your code to compute a whole range of spiral conductors automatically. Then you could proceed to process the results",True,0,0,,,
