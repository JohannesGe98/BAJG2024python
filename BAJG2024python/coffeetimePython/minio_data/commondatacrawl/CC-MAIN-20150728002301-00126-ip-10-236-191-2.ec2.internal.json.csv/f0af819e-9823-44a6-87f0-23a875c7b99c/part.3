The University of Florida is a very diverse campus and offers so many opportunities for those students who want to make the best of their education, whether it be in engineering, business, medicine, or tourism. If this description sounds like you, then the University of Florida is the right choice for you! Go Gators!', ""Get involved, live on campus, and take advantage of all the wonderful opportunities that UF has to offer. One of the best things that a student can do in college is to get involved in clubs and extracurricular activities. Here at the University of Florida, there are over 900 clubs that meet each and everyone's likings. Another tip is to live on campus! The best way to get to know the campus and experience campus life at its best is to live in a dorm for at least a semester. In addition to getting involved and living on campus, the last tip that I have for you is to take advantage of all the opportunities that UF has to offer, whether it is to attend the professor's office hours or to attend the Career Showcase held every semester. The University of Florida opens doors every day to better the future of the students and alumni who attend so take advantage and enjoy your college experience to the fullest!"", 'I can definitely agree with this statement. The University of Florida is one of the best universities in the state of Florida, let alone, in the nation as well. The price for which students pay at the University of Florida is well worth the education that students are receiving in return.', 'Most students and alumni can all agree that the four years that they spent here at the University of Florida are certainly some of the best years of their life. I have truly enjoyed my experiences here at UF and I would not give it up for the world. I have met my best friends here and have found a degree that fulfills my wants and needs for the future. One of the best things about the University of Florida is their campus and the fact that there is always something to do on campus, whether it be to attend Gator Nights or play on an intramural sports team or just meet up with friends and hang out at the Plaza of the Americas. The University of Florida is an exceptional school and I think anyone who attends this university will always enjoy the four years that they spend here.', 'One of best things about studying at the University of Florida are the professors and the teaching assistants. The professors here are extremely helpful and will go out of their way to make sure that students understand the material. If for some reason you attend a class and you do not understand the material that the professor taught that day, you can just show up to their office hours and they will help you with whatever it is that you did not understand. In addition, if the professor is not available, most courses have T.A.s (teachers assistants) that also have office hours and are very knowledgeable about the material being taught.']]",University of Florida (UF) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Florida/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/19130,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,106,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00126-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,888178871,887969948,HORIZONTAL,,"{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors.

The General Education classes, especially English, basic math, and Humanities, can be grueling to sit through when you already know the bulk of the information. General Ed classes are required, so there is no way around composition and humanities, unless you decide to take courses that you like. Try to take fun and interesting electives, things you want to explore and learn more about.', ""The tuition keeps going up year after year, but I think it is well worth the money. You aren't paying for just and education, you are paying for the experience. Students get to attend so many events and have opportunities to do so many things that they wouldn't normally do. The money is well used on campus for all activities like fitness, health, social events, clubs, and other such things."", 'There is always something to do while in Gainesville and on Campus. There are numerous clubs and groups that one can join. There are always events going on at the Union and in its surrounding areas. During the school day there are groups and clubs of people handing out information about their meetings and happenings. Aside from the social aspect, the schooling atmosphere is great. Teachers offer extra office hours to help you understand material, there are teaching labs and tutoring rooms offered to students. Its not hard to find help when you need it.', ""The course work is not always hard. It depends what subject area you are taking. General education classes are pretty simple and don't take too much time or effort. You just need to study the material given in class and then apply it on the exam.

I did not realize just how large this school actually was until I arrived. That being said, you will always meet someone new no matter where you go. Whether it be the library, dining hall, or just on the bus, you can always meet a new person.', ""Know how to adjust to the size of this school. It is extremely large, with a student population that is one of the largest in the nation. But this can be a plus as well, if you are the type who loves to meet new people. Befriend upperclassmen who can help you maneuver your way through the school, so they can help you choose the best teachers and classes! If you are an honors student, take advantage of the honors classes as they are very similar in size to high school classes; and that way, you'll be able to befriend honors students with similar interests."", ""Universities are becoming less and less affordable. And if you are a Florida resident, you really are lucky to have the Bright Futures Scholarship. The tuition of the University of Florida is increasing but the overall price of the education is worth it. You can't get the same education for this price anywhere else. It is the top research university in the state and has consistently been in the top 100 universities in the nation for its medical and research facilities."", ""I really do enjoy the fact that there is so much school spirit here. Especially during homecoming week, it gets you pumped up. I am not a big fan of sports but the people at this school get so hyped up for games that you can't help but join in the fun. The only downside I have to this school is that it is extremely large. It is hard to meet life long friends in classes just because a lot of the general education classes are 300+ people and you aren't sitting around the same people at every lecture. I wish there was a smaller student: teacher ratio."", ""I definitely had some doubts coming here. I graduated from a highly accredited International Baccalaureate Program so I had applied to top universities all over the country, including some Ivy Leagues. Because I didn't get into some of the schools I applied to, I was limited to the University of Florida (mainly for the cost). In my mind, I had this stereotype that the education standards of public schools weren't that competitive; however, I was definitely and totally wrong about that. I am a pre-med student here and I have met some of the smartest people at this school. This is not an easy A school by far (being medical-school bound) and you have to work hard to earn the best grade. It is very intellectually stimulating and that was what I had misjudged when I first arrived.

You have to be ready to put yourself out there and meet new people.', ""People complain about rising tuition prices and diminishing Bright Futures funds, but really, we get a great deal here. Florida residents pay some of the cheapest tuition in the country. However, I will say that UF doesn't really give scholarship money. I'm in the Honors Program and I didn't get any aid at all. But still, I'm very happy with the cost."", ""UF is pretty intimidating. There are thousands of students here and you really need to make an effort because it's really easy to get lost in the crowd. That being said, there are tons of opportunities to meet other people. During the first semester, the housing association puts on a ton of events for students to go to. Greek life has a really big presence on campus. Sorority recruitment is really intense and lots of girls end up dropping out or just plain being dropped. Those who make it in seem to love it but it's easy to be swept into the constant parties and socials. Obviously, football is really big on campus. On gamedays everything just stops. People park their cars and RVs in the middle of our fields, over sidewalks, and in front of buildings. The gameday spirit is infectious and you will come out of the stadium singing, It's great to be a Florida Gator! Still, if you're not into sports there's a place for you too. Not everyone here lives and breathes football. There are tons of clubs you can get involved that help you meet people and make friends. Be warned- UF is a party school. We have Gator Nights on Fridays which features new movies, crafts, entertainment, and free food, but there is really nothing to do on Saturday except go out to parties and clubs. So be warned!"", ""UF definitely has great academics! We have a great reputation not only in Florida but in the entire country. The admissions team isn't joking when they claim that the Gator Nation is everywhere. There are tons of networking options, internships, and research opportunities. The classes here aren't easy, but college isn't easy. You're not going to pay thousands of dollars for nothing. Keep in mind that UF is a big school. Many intro classes have hundreds if not thousands of students. However, these are usually broken down into smaller sections with TAs who are usually pretty helpful. Also, there are a ton of online classes. These usually have a live lecture opportunity but keep in mind that it's very easy to fall behind. This doesn't bode well for relationships with your professors. If you end up with online classes I recommend introducing yourself so you're not lost in the crowd. Professors are always available during office hours and there are tons of other resources like the Broward Teaching Center which is free for students. Still, I must say that UF does cater to its business, premed, and engineering students. These programs are definitely the strongest. That's not to say that the others are weak, but funding goes to the sciences before anything else.""]]",University of Florida (UF) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Florida/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/19130,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,117,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00126-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,888178871,887969948,HORIZONTAL,,"{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors.

The University of Florida has lots to offer for everyone.

Football is very popular on campus, I recommend going to a football game at least once.

Also, other than football - other sporting events are free for UF students!"", 'Definitely learning a lot - in many aspects other than from school.

life takes up a lot of your free time, but she loves it. some other friends say that everyone acts fake to impress each other and fit in but they don't mind it. unless you pledge a dry house (one that doesn't provide alcohol) expect to drink heavily weekly, age doesn't make a difference. the pressure to drink when you are part of a sorority or fraternity is more than you would expect. in my opinion, the friends you buy through joining a house (and its not cheep), aren't the kinds of friends you want to depend on for the next 4 years. but there are sororities and fraternities that aren't like this! although the other greeks don't really see them as really part of the greek life, there are some of dry houses. these are mostly the ones that have a christian or community service focus. these actually do provide life-long friendships and sisterhood/brotherhood. but beware, business/engineering/whatever frats (which are often co-ed) are not necessarily dry houses just because they aren't social houses."", 'the university of florida has so many different clubs, you are bound to find the perfect fit! if you want to get involved on campus, there are countless organizations you can join.', 'if you live in florida, you are definitely getting your moneys worth. especially if you have the bright futures scholarship. uf is not anymore expensive than the other universities in florida, but it is by far the best. if you are paying out of state tuition, it gets kinda pricey but not any more than any other florida university.', ""partttyy! no i'm kidding, please don't. there are plenty of other things to do here. in the reitz union they have bowling (and cosmic bowling on some nights), there is a roller skating alley a short drive away, gator nights every friday, and there's always some sort of game going on (football games are the best!). but fun isn't in the activities you do, but the people you are with. hanging out with your closest 20 friends is always a blast and you'l find that your circle of friends never stops growing. one of the best things to do over the weekends is to go to lake wauberg. you can go kayaking, sailing, canoeing, swimming, rock climbing and a whole bunch of other stuff for free with your gator 1 id card. plus, each uf student can bring 2 non-students with them for when your non-uf friends come to visit. but if you must, there's plenty of partying every night in midtown or at the frat houses."", ""the meal plans are great for the first couple weeks but by the end of the semester you will hate the dining hall food. i wouldn't suggest getting a meal plan. the way the dining hall works is essentially a buffet. you pay a certain amount (at most $9 if you don't have any meal plan, or just swipe your id if you do have one) and you can stay there and eat as much as you want. downside: foods not that great, non-paying friends can't come in with you, closes at 11 and opens at 10(?), not many healthy choices. upside: you never have to cook or buy groceries. i would suggest eating at the dining hall or any restaurant for the first couple of weeks while you get settled (you can pay cash or card or whatever) and then buy groceries and make your own food. publix and target (walmart doesn't have a good selection of food) have plenty of frozen microwavable dinners. every traditional dorm has a microwave, stove, and oven in its lounge by the way. as far as restaurants go, we have a pretty good selection. we have food courts in the reitz union, the hub, and next to the student rec center. if you don't want to eat at any of the restaurants in there, you can always walk down university avenue which has plenty of places to eat."", ""it's not terrible, but it's not wonderful either. i would suggest living in a dorm for the first year, because it is convenient and close to classes. you also meet lots of great people and usually you live close to your friends. beware of the random roommate. here are some of the demographics off the top of my head: the traditional dorms have no co-ed floors, but all buildings are co-ed (1st floor is boys, 2nd floor is girls) east: all the engineers, 15 min walk to turlington (where most classes will be) weaver: all the foreigners, connected to east graham and trusler: normal people, 30 second walk to weaver broward: party place, 5 min walk to turlington yulee: normal people, 7 min walk to turlington in the apartment style dorms, all floors are co-ed murphery (spelling may be a bit off): closest you can get to turlington, its like a 2 min walk beaty towers: lots of greeks, close to sorority row, 15 min walk to turlington"", ""again, if you party you have a slim chance of being successful at this school. know that classes here are difficult and very different than any class you've taken at the ap or dual enrollment level. learning is completely up to you and you need to be self motivated. do not fall behind. you need to hit the ground running from the first day of class. have your books bought before school starts (amazon and other online sites are great if you're on a budget) and start your reading on the first day. study groups are really helpful, try to establish one in each class within the first couple weeks and don't wait until the final comes around. stay off of facebook. facebook will take up more hours in your day than you spend sleeping (that's a joke, college students don't sleep)."", ""if you love to party, don't come here. there are parties every night and if you don't have your priorities straight, your grades will suffer dramatically. it's easier than you think to fail a class. for you that don't plan on trying the party scene, no fear, there are plenty of students that don't party that you can spend your time with. also, avoiding parties is not difficult. random roommates don't always turn out the way you think they will. if you have rules about the opposite sex sleeping in the room, drinking/coming home drunk, being messy, etc. then i strongly suggest moving in with someone you know and have talked about your standards with. if you have to have a random, go over the rules in the beginning of the semester. also, get to know your ras, tas, professors, and advisers. if you're still applying, know that your essay is what makes or breaks you. plenty of students here do not have the ideal gpas or standardized test scores. you want them to know that you're more than just some grades. show them when you have been a leader, or what you have planned for your future. you want your essay to tug at their hearts. let them know that you absolutely must go to this school, and don't forget some gator pride!"", ""the university of florida has a ton of wonderful opportunities! teachers and staff do their best to get you internships, jobs, and important connections. we have so many different groups you can join and so many different people you will meet, there's a place for everyone here. you

impossible. you will have to study or drop out of college. for business (i'm minoring in entrepreneurship), some classes are weed-out classes as is calc i for engineers, since so many aspire to be the same thing. they want to see who's serious about their future, so it's not for the faint of heart. i have no clue about other bs majors (people who major in something cuz they don't have it figured out yet or don't want to work hard in college), but if you're aspiring to do that, apparently you'll have a lot of time to party (something i don't have -

about one-fourth of the students are involved in a greek organization. apart from the well known frats and sororities who are popularized by parties and socials, there are also those that are academically focused. there are business, nursing, pharmacy, medical, law, etc. co-ed or gender specific greek organizations that allow students to mingle with people sharing similar academic interests while having a good time socializing.', 'we have literally over 900 organizations on campus! if you like something, we have it! this is a great way to get involved whether it be through meeting people who are of like culture, share your interest in sports, or enjoy running around like humans vs zombies (a ridiculous campus wide game of tag that literally lasts for days where observes can see people running around with bandanas and water guns all day and all night long)! seriously our campus offers something for everyone!', 'the f-book is a tradition at the university of florida for the newly accepted freshman given this book filled with 100 different tasks to complete in that first year varying from taking a picture with the bull gator to going to your first uf basketball game. if you complete a certain number of them you get a prize and the more you complete the better the prize:)', ""where to start?! honestly there are fun things for everyone because every individual has their own idea of what is entertaining! there are loads of bars and clubs around campus filled with students every night. if partying isn't for you there are free of charge gator nights for students to watch movies on the big screen, bowl or play pool, various other activities (like go carts and lazor tag) that change week to week and, of course, loads of free food! lake wauberg is where lots of people go on the weekends because they have a giant obstacle course, ropes course, canoeing and sailing boats for use as well as lessons, and other activities all free of charge for students:) the university of florida really does offer a lot of benefits to the students."", ""the dining hall is really quite impressive for school food. included in the price of a meal you can get unlimited amounts of food and beverage as well as free trade coffee and locally made delicious ice cream. there is a very large variety of choices for every meal and the food hall is open from very early to very late. they have also taken part in the no meat monday's campaign and promote using reusable tupperware by distributing it and giving a discount for being environmentally conscious. many of the ingredients that are served in the dining halls are grown and produced by the college of agriculture which truly shows that the university does actively involve the students in the running of the school."", 'i lived in the dorms for my first two years and really enjoyed the experience. those who are in charge of student living arrange many events (sometimes several a week) like costume parties, shaving cream fights, and always loads of food which makes it very easy to make new friends. the ras are, from what i experienced and have heard from other friends, very laid back and usually stay out of your business unless there is a problem and at those times they can be very helpful.', 'especially for those students that are admitted directly after high school, the transition of going from the high school to college level can be challenging. the classes are usually demanding and call for a lot of effort outside of the classroom. as for doing well in courses, it truly depends on what your major is and how disciplined you are.', ""becoming apart of the gator nation is truly a privilege that should not be under played! upon admission into the university, you truly feel that you are an important and valuable addition to the school. this school admits very academically inclined students, talented athletes, and innovative thinkers and leaders of the community. the pay off of becoming a florida gator is worth putting forth the effort in high school or community college. it's a decision you will never regret!"", 'the university of florida is filled with such a wide variety of students that all come together to form an amazing student body. our school provides a way to become involved in any and every type of organization which guarantees that every individual will find a niche of friends. i believe the university of florida is an amazing college academically, athletically, and socially that encourages the students to become involved and better themselves.']]",University of Florida (UF) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Florida/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/19130,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,145,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00126-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,888178871,887969948,HORIZONTAL,,"{34809=Get everything together early and be as prepared as possible to apply by that November 1 deadline - UF has scrapped Early Decision along with a few ivies in the country., 1094294=Make sure to really work on your application to UF to make sure there are no errors.

They offer equipment for these activities for free with a student ID and each student can bring up to four guests.

There are police scattered throughout campus readily on call and on duty. Emergency notifications are sent to all students whenever there is something going on in campus, so you will always know what's happening. Even so, knowing when to be out, locking your doors, and making sure to stay safe is strongly suggested in order to make sure that you are doing your best at keeping yourself safe at all times."", ""Fraternities and sororities are not essential to the college experience, but certainly you will be living up the true social life by joining one. Find a fraternity or sorority that really fits you and you'll find friends that will probably last a lifetime. The greek life is truly what makes the college social experience so much different from high school, so it is recommended that you at least try it out!"", ""Clubs and activities are a central part of UF. There are clubs for different religions and races, alongs with shows, performances, and events planned for each of these clubs. There is a club fair at some point during a preview session that you go to before coming to UF in which all these clubs, some of which are open to all, but others targeting a more specific group, are able to present their mission statement and share more about what they do so you can see if you're interested in which club."", ""If you're the type of student who loves to be social and interactive, willing to try new things, creative and open to experience, then you'll have a blast at UF. IF you're the type of student who loves to be isolated, loving to enjoy a quiet read in the library, and play music by yourself, you'll also find a place here. UF is made for everyone, and there is no discrimination on what type of personality you have. You just have to find the right spot and people who share similar values and goals as yourself and no matter what, you'll still live the college experience."", 'There are some really unusual traditions and locations on campus, but some of my favorite are the dance marathon and the underwear run. For the dance marathon, you literally dance for 26.2 hours straight, and it is a super fun (but tiring) experience. The underwear run is even more unusual, but the title says it all; one night, a whole bunch of college students go and run around campus in their underwear.', ""Certainly, college is one of the more expensive experiences that you'll come across in life. However, UF is definitely worth it. The teachers and experience that you get from this campus is a value worth much more than money. If you happen to live outside campus, there is a great system called the RTS, which is a bus service that can take you almost anywhere around Gainesville and back to anywhere on campus. It's free for UF students and is a great resource. The only complaints are that living on campus is relatively expensive, as is the meal plan, and with any college, the books can feel a bit too pricey as well, which is why it is better to order some stuff online or buy used from others."", ""There's so much to do at UF because there's always events going on. Whether you enjoy playing pool or bowling in the game room at the Reitz, enjoying a nice book to yourself in a study lounge at Library West, or playing ball with a group of friends at the gym, there should not be a time when you say that you are bored, while you are on campus and not in class."", ""You can get meal plans at UF or you can just go around to the various restaurants scattered around campus. There's even a vegan restaurant known as Krishnas that provides very healthy, cheap lunches in the plaza at UF. If you're looking for quality food, there's not a whole lot of options on campus, but for variety and convenience, UF has it all."", ""Dorm life is a fun, social experience, where you get to bond with people whom you may have never hung out with before. You really grow close with the community and the people there and hopefully your roommate as well! It's very easy to get around campus while living in the dorm, so it's really a great experience for first-year students."", ""This will vary depending on major, but most likely you will stumble across some fairly difficult classes. Chemistry, biology, physics, and calculus are usually doable, but some people still have problems. But when it comes to classes such as financial accounting, organic chemistry, and the like, that's when people really freak out. When it comes to that, make sure you know how to manage your time and understand your priorities. That party may sound great, but really, you need to think about your future and what your real goal is as a college student."", 'If you know some upperclassmen, utilize them for help and resources. Their knowledge of the campus and experience will go far in helping you have the smoothest transition from high school to college.', ""UF is a social hub of some of the brightest and funnest people in Florida. There are always new people to meet, of different races and religions, and places to go all around campus.

The school itself has a police department that circulates campus 24/7. There are many emergency poles located pretty much everywhere on campus. These emergency poles are poles with a emergency button that a student can press to contact deputy when in contact with danger. UF also has a safety night time auxiliary patrol, which is a service that will pick students up at night at the student's request."", 'There are always activities going on somewhere on campus. Many clubs have talent shows and performances. I usually attend Gator nights every friday. Gator nights are a great way to meet people and go out and have fun. Gator nights are held every Fridays and consist of movies, popcorn, arts and crafts, and so many other forms of entertainment.', 'Food and Dining is great. There are two main dining halls and great varieties of restaurants on campus. There are also many restaurants off campus if on campus food ever gets mundane or tiring.', ""I would recommend all students to experience the dorm life for at least two semester terms. Students are not required to live on campus, but its a great experience. The dorms at UF aren't so bad at all. They're made at a great comfort level to make students feel at home. There are always activities planned for students living in dorms Ex: We always have pancake and ice cream nights. Living in dorms also helps in building social and communication skills considering the fact that you meet a lot of people living in dorms."", 'The courses are definitely not a breeze. Courses at University of Florida are challenging and the professors are great. Though the courses are a challenge there are many resources that can assist students with the help they may need.', 'Prospective students should make schedules for themselves and use their time wisely. Procrastination is a college student worst enemy. Join many clubs and activities. This is a very important aspect at the University of Florida. Being at a big school can be overwhelming so its great to be involved and get to know people. Also, use the resources on campus. University of Florida has many resources like free tutoring for various subjects and a counseling and wellness center.', ""On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the highest I rate University of Florida a 10.

I have had no problems calling one of my male friends to meet me somewhere, and they definitely do not mind or think I'm paranoid. In fact, they would rather I did that than walk somewhere late at night, so no, I don't think the campus is all that safe. They have the emergency blue light buttons that you are supposed to be able to see from any place on campus (I think that's debatable, but that's what we're told). There is also nighttime transportation and UPD, but still, I wouldn't walk many places at night by myself."", ""I'm not involved in Greek life, and I've only been to one party at a UF frat. It was basically what you'd expect. I don't know that UF's Greek life differs extraordinarily from Greek life at other places."", ""There is definitely no shortage of clubs at UF, but to me, tey are either so large that you feel lost in the crowd as a member, or they are so small that they are insignificant/don't do much. It seems that my friends at smaller universities/colleges have a much more fulfilling experience with their clubs and organizations."", ""If you want a large university, UF is definitely for you. However, if you want to be able to walk around and know somebody when you go somewhere, that probably isn't going to happen very often here. Uf is immersed in the city of Gainesville, so a lot of events and activities take place off-campus, which I find to be less of a college experience."", 'The F Book has a list of around 60 traditions that students can participate in. If a student completes 10, 20, 30, or 40 traditions in their time as a student, they can wear a special pin/medallion at graduation as a Tradition Keeper.', ""There are certainly a lot of perks that come with tuition in the form of student services and available activities. You aren't just paying for the academics, so that's good. Then again, if you never use the infirmary or the gym or the bus or... well, those costs could seem pointless to you. However, I think every student uses the available services at least a few times."", ""There are lots of outdoor activities for adventurous people and about 1,000 clubs on campus. Gainesville has anything any other city has (for the most part), and if you have a group of friends, you won't be bored. The gyms on campus have group classes all day from 7am til 11pm, and those are a lot of fun, even if you aren't generally a fitness oriented person. There's always an event with food or free stuff somewhere on campus (benefit of a large campus), so no one should ever really be bored."", ""The two dining halls are decent, but I think they get old, and the meal plans are too expensive. However, there are lots of chain establishments (Burger King, Starbucks, Subway, Chick-fil-a, Quiznos, Einstein Bros., Chili's, Moe's, etc.), and those are obviously good. You can use your Flex Bucks (meal plan) at those places, so that's good if you have that."", ""I never lived in the dorms, but I have had friends who have, and I have visited dorms at many other schools. I think Uf's dorm quality is sub-par, but they are sufficient if you literally just want a place to live. I would have had no problem living in the dorm (I chose not to have a roommate, though), but if the quality is really important to you, you'll end up farther away from classroom buildings and taking the bus to classes each day."", ""UF is definitely going to provide you with a good education, assuming you take advantage of it. There are lots of large classes, and you have to be able to learn the material on your own. That is, you have to be able to use resources on your own. There are plenty of ways to get help and learn material, but don't expect it all to come from the classroom."", 'If you come to this school with people you know, make sure you also get involved in something away from the friends you already have!

I pledged my fraternity the first Fall I was here and it was the best decision I have made so far at UF. Greek life makes a campus of 50,000 seem a little bit smaller and easier to meet other students. Fraternities and sororities are always interacting with each other whether it's through philanthropies and service projects or socials and tailgates. I would 100% recommend Greek life to anyone coming to UF, it certainly has made helped mold my college experience so far"", ""There are a few lakes and rivers in the surrounding areas and in Gainesville itself and during the hot summer and early Fall/late Spring the rivers are a perfect place to float down with your friends and soak up some sun. There's also an on-campus bowling alley in the Reitz, Gator Nights and football games in the Fall, tons of fields for athletics and tons of clubs to join for more stuff to do as well."", ""There are the usual places to eat on campus like Subway, Jamba Juice and Burger King but we have places that aren't as common like Moe's and Chili's on campus along with Panda Express in the Reitz food court. We also have a handful of Starbucks around campus and in libraries and those are key for late study sessions."", ""I lived in the dorms my first Summer B and then the following Fall and Spring semesters. UF is very good about planning events, presentations and activities through the dorm life for incoming guys and girls. The facilities are all pretty nice from what I hear too so you can't really go wrong. Dorming is something I suggest for the first year at least, it puts you in a social environment with people in the same boat as you."", ""I am an aerospace and mechanical engineering major and it is difficult so far.

Some of them have been renovated but they are nothing like the dorms at most of the newer universities in the state. The bathrooms are just as old as the dorms which leads to leaky faucets, tubs that don't drain, and malfunctioning toilets."", 'Academic rigor obviously depends on the intensity of the major that one chooses and how suited he/she is for their major. Usually majors related to the sciences, accounting, and design require the most attention. However there are some outliers in other areas too.', 'Prospective students should stay focused at all times. While in college, students may find it easy to lose sight of their goals. Stay on track at all times and all of your hard work will pay off.', 'The University of Florida is an institution that prepares students for their future whether it includes continuing education or entering the job market. Professors are demanding and have high expectations of students and in some cases, it is almost impossible to achieve the longed for A at the end of the semester.

You can learn to dance, be in a dance showcase, do community service of any kind at all, or even join a club that has to do with your major so you can get some insight on how the industry works. Join a club or two, and your weeknights won't be boring at all =)"", ""As I mentioned before, Gatornights is great at UF. There is always a lot to do and a great movie playing. Gatornights is especially great for students who aren't interested in the typical college drinking on weekends. I would much rather hang out with friends at Gatornights or at the gym instead of going to bars or parties. Gatornights is also great because you can bring a non UF guest. So you don't have to steer clear of campus activities if your friends or family don't have a UF ID."", 'Gatornights is a great deal at UF! At the Reitz Union you can see recently releases movies for free as well do awesome crafts. Free popcorn and sodas are served for the movie and the food court is usually open as well. Going to SW Rec is also fun because you can just store your stuff in a locker and explore the endless opportunities in that amazing facility.', ""There is a wide variety of food and dining on campus, all conveniently located! Right across the street from UF is decently priced food of every kind! Jimmy John's, Pita Pit, Sushi, BBQ, and much more! Between restaurants and dining halls, you won't go hungry in Gainesville."", 'Although I did not live in a dorm, I have heard about some experiences. Freshman seem to be very satisfied living in a dorm for the first semester or even a year. Its a great experience to have. After living in a dorm, my friends have enjoyed transitioning into a more roomy apartment.', ""Classes are tough overall. Sometimes you get a class that seems like your getting a little break from the intensity of college, however, you are more likely to have to put in a lot of work and time into your classes. Visiting teachers during office hours is a great idea because that's the best help you can get. If it is an assembly class (tons of people) and you know your weak in the subject (i.e. chemistry) then I recommend the Broward Teaching Center and possibly a one-on-one tutor from Broward."", ""Think about how you prefer to get to school. Living off campus, I take the bus, which is great because I live close enough that its a short ride. Biking to school is the BEST if the weather is nice, plus its environmentally friendly! Also, put some thought into your major, but don't over think it. There are endless opportunities with ANY and EVERY major."", 'UF is a beautiful campus with lots of trees and grass, which makes it enjoyable to walk through, eat lunch outside, and hang out with friends.

Aim for an SAT and ACT score within their middle 50% (somewhere between a 1900 and 2100 for the SAT and 27-31 for the ACT) or better, and make sure to take many rigorous classes in high school. Also, show a passion for attending UF in your essays or elsewhere on your application., 582346=i guess we're safe... there's blue emergency lights scattered around the campus, a separate police dept for uf, and scan-card dorms, but rapings and suspects with guns have been reported to the students via email and text just in fall 2011. oh and some shots fired... but i haven't seen anything, which is good. just make smart choices. the person who got raped, got in the car for a ride to campus with an elderly male she didn't know., 613241=there is so much to do at the university of florida! in the reitz union there is a game room with a bowling alley which is always a lot of fun. uf also has gator nights every friday night, where students can go to the reitz union for free and partake in a bunch of activities including midnight breakfast. they also show movies in the reitz union on fridays. there are also about 1000 clubs at uf as well as multiple sororities and fraternities. lastly the gator nation is very big on football. there's nothing like being in the swamp cheering on the gators with your gator family., 911913=There are numerous blue light emergency posts everywhere on campus, and guarantee police assistance within 60 seconds of when the button was pushed. A free snap transportation service is provided, which gives students a ride anywhere on campus after 3:00 AM., 49808=UF is one of the top 50 universities in the US and a great education for a tuition of about $4000 a year and housing is about $2000 for each semester is an amazing deal. If you received Bright Futures you really only have to pay for housing (and of course books and food.) UF also has many research opportunities with top-rated professors available for undergraduates., 48916=Apply as early as possible, way before the November 1st deadline. The earlier you apply, the earlier you can apply for housing (if you are planning on living on campus.) I find that living on campus is really convenient, where you can literally wake up ten minutes before your class and still make it. Off campus has it's perks but it costs about the same as on campus housing and you have to take the bus (which are often times always late.) I suggest living on campus for at least your first year. Also, UF seems to emphasize this quite a lot but GET INVOLVED! Try something new!

Hemodynamic measurements that suggest septic shock are an increased cardiac output, with a low systemic vascular resistance. Abnormalities of the complete blood count (CBC), laboratory test results, clotting factors, and acute-phase reactants might indicate sepsis (Table 1). Signs and symptoms Back to Top As a result of the vicious cycle of inflammation and coagulation, cardiovascular insufficiency and multiple organ failure occur, and often lead to death. Cardiovascular insufficiency can occur at the level of the myocardium as a result of the myocardial depressant effects of TNF or at the level of the vessel, caused by vasodilation and capillary leak.16 Severe Sepsis: The Final Common Pathway CD4 lymphocytes play a key role in the inflammatory response seen in sepsis. Early in the sepsis process, these cells assume a TH1 phenotype, where they produce large amounts of the proinflammatory mediators, including interferon gamma, TNF-√é¬±, and IL-2. CD4 lymphocytes may evolve over time to a Th2 phenotype, whereby the CD4 lymphocytes produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13. This is often driven by the release of stress hormones, such as catecholamines and corticosteroids. These cytokines dampen the immune response and can lead to the deactivation of monocytes. Additionally, TNF released","ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate transaminase; DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation; PT, prothrombin time; PTT, partial thromboplastin time; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

But the House of Representatives uses √¢¬Ä¬úAye√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úNo√¢¬Ä? in other sorts of votes. The U.S. Constitution says that bills should be decided on by the √¢¬Ä¬úyeas and nays√¢¬Ä? (Article I, Section 7). Congress takes this literally and uses √¢¬Ä¬úyea√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬únay√¢¬Ä? when voting on the final passage of bills. √¢¬Ä¬úAye√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úYea√¢¬Ä? mean the same thing, and so do √¢¬Ä¬úNo√¢¬Ä? and √¢¬Ä¬úNay√¢¬Ä?. Congress uses different words in different sorts of votes. √¢¬Ä¬úAye√¢¬Ä? or √¢¬Ä¬úYea√¢¬Ä?? House Rules, Rule I(7).) The Speaker of the House is not required to vote in √¢¬Ä¬úordinary legislative proceedings, except when such vote would be decisive.√¢¬Ä? In practice, this means the Speaker of the House rarely votes and only does so when it is politically useful. When the Speaker declines to vote, he or she is simply omitted from the roll call by the House Clerk. (See The Speaker√¢¬Ä¬ôs Vote? Notes: Vote Details ideology score.

It is important to note that by ages eight or nine, most children have the necessary reading level, problem-solving skills and hand-eye coordination (or skill-level) to play just about any game. After this age, the main things you'll need to determine are what kinds of games your child likes to play and what kind of game content is appropriate for your family. For help determining the appropriate content, link to our section on selecting the right games for your family. How is the player's hand-eye coordination? What is the child's problem-solving skill level? What is the child's reading level?

Many video rental","What is the child's reading level? If a child is not able to read more complicated sentences and vocabulary, you may want to avoid role playing games (RPG's), strategy games, and adventure titles. Typically, these games have a large amount of written text. Because completion of the game depends upon understanding the text, many children who cannot read will become lost. Puzzle, Action and Racing games are the best types of games for those still early in learning reading. What is the child's problem-solving skill level? When a child is given a puzzle to solve, do they tend to give up quickly or do they stick with it? Players who enjoy mind challenges tend to favor games like Puzzle, Adventure, Role Playing and certain Action titles. Some of these games, however, will occasionally require stronger reading skills. For Adventure games, specifically, additional research is advised. Researching articles in Nintendo Power and on our website can provide a better overview of a game, or renting the game first to see if the child can understand and enjoy the title. Link here for more information about researching games. How is the player's hand-eye coordination? Does your child enjoy working with their hands? Do they tend to do well in activities that require fine motor skills, such as coloring between the lines and lettering?

A 1-component floating-point format that uses 16-bits per component is GL_R16F. ""_SNORM"": Signed normalized integer format. ""UI"": Unsigned integral format. The values go from [0, MAX_INT] for the integer size. ""I"": Signed integral format. Thus GL_RGBA8I gives a signed integer format where each of the four components is an integer on the range [-128, 127]. ""F"": Floating-point. Thus, GL_RGBA32F is a floating-point format where each component is a 32-bit IEEE floating-point value. The components field is the list of components that the format stores. OpenGL only allows ""R"", ""RG"", ""RGB"", or ""RGBA""; other combinations are not allowed as internal image formats. The size is the bitdepth for each component. The type indicates which of the 5 types mentioned above the format is stored as. No type at all means normalized unsigned integers. For other types, the following suffixes are used:  GL_[components][size][type] OpenGL has a particular syntax for writing its color format enumerants. It looks like this:   Texture swizzling can change what the missing values are. Note:  Image formats do not have to store each component. When the shader samples such a texture, it will still resolve to a 4-value RGBA vector. The","GL_R11F_G11F_B10F: This uses special 11 and 10-bit floating-point values. An 11-bit float has no sign-bit; it has 6 bits of mantissa and 5 bits of exponent. A 10-bit float has no sign-bit, 5 bits of mantissa and 5 bits of exponent. This is very economical for floating-point values (using only 32-bits per value), so long as your floating-point data will fit within the given range. And so long as you can live without the destination alpha. GL_RGB9_E5: This one is complicated. It is an RGB format of type floating-point. The 3 color values have 9 bits of precision, and they share a single exponent. The computation for these values is not as simple as for GL_R11F_G11F_B10F, and they aren't appropriate for everything. But they can provide better results than that format if most of the colors in the image have approximately the same exponent, or are too small to be significant. This is a required format, but it is not required for renderbuffers; do not expect to be able to render to these. sRGB colorspace Normally, colorspaces are assumed to be linear. However, it is often useful to provide color values in non-linear colorspaces. OpenGL provides support for the sRGB colorspace with two formats: GL_SRGB8: sRGB image with no alpha. GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8: sRGB image with a linear Alpha. These are normalized integer formats.",True,1,0,
