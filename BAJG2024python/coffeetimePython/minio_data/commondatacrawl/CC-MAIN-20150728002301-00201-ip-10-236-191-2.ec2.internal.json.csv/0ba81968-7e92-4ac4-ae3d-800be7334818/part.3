There are so many educational resources, student organizations, and professors with advanced degrees. UNC Charlotte is a well-run institution. The website is thorough and user-friendly. Am enjoying being here The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is unfortunately attributed as a",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural).

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

The prices are not exaggerated too much but, with food, for example, it is cheaper to just bring your own food. The book store does have a clearance section that you can find school gear at decent prices though there are local vendors that sell school gear, right across the street, at really good prices (Grey's book store is a great location)."", 'The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is a great location because we have Concord Mills mall, 10 minutes north, and downtown Charlotte, 10 minutes south. At the Student Union building on campus we have our own movie theater, free for students, that is awesome to go to and there are also pool tables and weekly activities in this building for students such as competitions and such. There is also the Greenway that runs right through campus and around Charlotte that offers students a great way to exercise or just to go for a walk on around campus. Tennis courts are also available for students to play on (I have done so many times). For people of drinking age, there are plenty of chill bars to go to close to campus to go out with friends to.', ""I believe that our school has an excellent variety of dining options. Dining plans are offered so that you don't have to carry change with you and you can just use your student card. Our campus has local vendors such as Wendy's, Mama Leon's, Einstein's Bagels, Bojangles and Chik-fil-a. There are also two cafeteria locations to eat at."", ""There are a lot more on campus living options now than when I first came to this school. Of course the newer buildings are nicer looking than the older ones. I've known people that usually made life long friends with the people they met through dorm life at this school and people that have also learned important social skills because of living with different people."", 'They offer a great array of different classes. I am part of the Languages department and I know from personal experience that they do try and help you with your classes. Though you have to prepare to plan your class schedule ahead of time because there are classes only offered in the Fall or Spring semesters so if one is not careful they could get behind a semester or two for not planning correctly. Signing up on time for a class is crucial, especially if you are at a higher level class since there is probably only one class offered for each section.', ""Make sure you plan your class schedule ahead of registration time so that you can register for classes right off the bat and avoid the chance of it getting filled. Also, keep in mind the location of the classes you are choosing to make sure you have time to walk to each class. If you plan to commute to campus, make sure you give yourself an hours amount of spare time to find parking since, especially during the first and last two weeks of school can be hectic and spaces hard to find. Also, you might want to look into off-campus parking to avoid the high price for the parking sticker. If you love sports, make sure you get involved in Niner Nation Gold. This is an exceptional student organization that is dedicated to school spirit and emphasizes students involvement in sporting events. Plus the atmosphere at the games you get is pretty stellar! Find and join any student clubs or organizations that seem interesting to you, it is the best way to meet people, especially if you come from a private school or out of state. If you don't have a lot of money, or are a broke student like myself, save yourself some money by bringing your own snacks/lunches on campus; there is good food here on campus but it can get pricey. It's an amazing school and has a great campus, remember to enjoy they time you have here!"", 'The University of North Carolina has a great student body with school spirit. This University is composed of an impressive mix of different cultures and ethnicity. The campus offers different social societies and clubs for students to get involved in and since the campus is about three miles in width, it offers great exercise opportunities.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/58125,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,76,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00201-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,908957295,908795961,HORIZONTAL,,"06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments.

If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

We just took a trip to Canada in a world class resort, but due to some bad leadership, we couldn't get a lot of money the University would otherwise given to us to reimburse us. Kind of a crappy situation that could easily be fixed by the University, but they're cold heartless businessmen. Bastards. The Paintball club had a table set up the opening week, too bad no one was there. I would probably have joined if they'd just shown up. Overall above average."", ""People who didn't quite make it into the good schools, but still need a good education.

Aside from that there isn't much anything else to do on campus except drink, which happens on wednesday evenings or during class. Location is bad."", ""There is a good food buffet at Crown Commons, but I hear people complain about eating there everyday. There is only two eating centers worth going to: Prospector and Crown Commons. The other is Residence Dining Hall by the High Rises, and I've heard it called Rather Die Hungry, so it's not the best place. At Prospector the line for Chick-fil-a is aways ridiculously long, and the fiesty's takes forever to make your food."", ""I don't live on campus and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. Parking space is utterly lacking. I've heard stories about people going out for 5 minutes out of their parking space at 4 am, only to come back and find that it was taken. Dorms suck pretty bad, I've visited friends in the High Rises, looks like the last time that building wasn't grey and depressing was before they built it. Many dorms don't have cell phone service, so that is pretty fun. All the people usually go home on the weekends, making dorm life pretty boring. Nothing sizable is close, a few shopping centers, but nothing that doesn't take 15 minutes one way to walk to. Would not recommend."", ""Classes can be hard, especially chemistry.

Understand the information and make sure you can do some of the sample problems. If there aren't any problems assigned, you should still look into the sample problems from the book. Sleep is important. Your roommates in your dorm will probably be up all night and making noise, so don't be afraid to invest in some husqvarna hearing protection. Finally, GO TO CLASS. You're paying a lot of money to have your classes, even if you don't feel you get anything out of the class, you're likely not to look over the information otherwise. Also, go ahead and challenge yourself. Get more than 15 credit hours, it all costs the same and it will save you time in the end."", ""The college is a good strong step up from community colleges, and also a good fallback if you don't get into NCState or Chapel Hill.

Also the higher the course, the more chance of there being a group project, many times major and semester long.', ""Try to avoid freshman housing, lots of complaints about roommates, sound, and lights.

The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus.

However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am.

Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes.

Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural).

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions.

Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students.

Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Therefore, it's geared towards helping freshman build better relationships with their roommates in order to focus on enhancing your education.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here!

If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life.

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am.

If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes.

Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Most of my professors have been fair. My main issue with the university is the amount of money they charge in random fees. Parking is especially expensive and its nearly impossible to find a spot. Its an okay place to learn however if I had it to do over again, I would have completed my degree elsewhere.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/58125,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,108,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00201-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,908957295,908795961,HORIZONTAL,,"06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life.

We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The campus is easily",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world.

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The best security on campus is in the library.

(The campus reporting for these events is pretty interesting too... just be aware universities have some unique methods of categorizing crimes)', 'If anyone actually posts an activity or membership drive before the deadline date, there are a lot of clubs varying in activity level. It is fine for resume fodder.', 'Non traditional students, commuter students and students looking for a government job.', 'The gardens are well managed and beautiful. In the spring, you can watch the managed bee colonies swarm which is pretty groovy.', 'NC is a cheap state for tuition. UNCC was a good deal until the school started cutting classes and raising tuition to pay for the unnecessary football team.', 'Go somewhere else. The student union tries to put on functions but most of them remind me of girl scout camp. There is a religious guy who stands at the tower in the spring to remind students of their pathway to hell...that can be interesting for a few minutes.', 'Chartwells...what more can I say. Food service quality and gourmet prices. The single source food contract has left students with few options (all overpriced). However, the Indian buffet across the street is cheap and rocks.', 'If there is one it is only because the campus has no life leaving students in their dorms when escape is not an option.', 'You can find rigorous classes however the students complain so much most professors are forced to curve the grades beyond any reasonable measure.', 'Be aware of your surroundings! Security is light and you are pretty much on your own. Do not trust the advising staff. You can be told 3 different things by 3 different counselors. Go to the department and find out what you will need to graduate! The area around campus is pretty much the ghetto. Besides the danger factor, there are no 24 hour coffee shops or groovy little diners for stimulating conversation and the closest cultural experience not related to gang activity would be found downtown. Just be prepared to make the best out of it...', 'UNCC is a fairly impersonal university and can feel a bit like extended community college. If you work very hard to cultivate relationships with professors, there are opportunities but with large classes sizes and harried departments this is completely up to you.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students. There are so many educational resources, student organizations, and professors with advanced degrees. UNC Charlotte is a well-run institution. The website is thorough and user-friendly.

It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes.

However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many ez^Ž)•o'vp°û7òš¯l@m×$4/éÔ}¡>ìmergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Don't let this get you down, study hard and GO TO CLASS and tutoring if need be. Our Nursing Program is number 3 in the country for all you intended nursing majors so that means it's hard, just do your best. Our LBST classes, which every has to take are usually easy A's so MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A's in these classes, they're easy so why not?

They're really nice people and can offer you advice on courses to take, internship opportunities, scholarships, and they're just generally great people to talk to. They've been through the schooling and coursework already so they'll understand the ups and downs of your major."", ""UNC Charlotte is not only a great school for commuter students, but it caters specifically to one of the most diverse student bodies in the entire UNC school system.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students. There are so many educational resources, student organizations, and professors with advanced degrees. UNC Charlotte is a well-run institution. The website is thorough and user-friendly. Am enjoying being here The University of North Carolina at Charlotte",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural).

Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation. Bang for the buck Tuition and associated educational expenses are resonable for both in and out of state students. There are so many educational resources, student organizations, and professors with advanced degrees. UNC Charlotte is a well-run institution. The website is thorough and user-friendly. Am enjoying being here The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is unfortunately attributed as a",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early.

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college.

My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home.

The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy.

The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus.

The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

Am learning a lot The teachers are always",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The campus is easily accessible and organized in a sensible manner. If you are a commuting student prepare to arrive prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. If small college-towns are not a deal breaker and you don't mind a lightly populated campus on the weekends then UNCC is a great place to call your home. Tips for prospective students If commuting, arrive on campus prior to your first class as parking can be a challenge. For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus. If you and your roommates experience any confrontation your RA can assist you in setting some ground rules or mediating the situation.

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am.

Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym.

Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester.

Tips for prospective students Make sure that you look at the school before you come! It is a commuter school so on weekends a lot of people go home, but there is always something to do. The advisors are helpful too if the major you want isn't offered or you are undecided. Bang for the buck In-state tuition is extremely low, and even out-of-state tuition isn't terrible. Apply for residency and you'll definitely be getting your moneys worth. Am enjoying being here I've met the nicest people down here, and have rented out an apartment because the atmosphere is so great! Am learning a lot The teachers are always available to help and utilize online resources often during class to keep things from getting dull. The general education classes can be a pain but the more specialized your classes become the better the teachers become. Login to rate or flag the reviews Nicole from Waxhaw,",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms.

It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State.

Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely.

For all students, make yourself aware of all campus resources, including safe-ride. Safe-ride provides transportation both to and from any location on campus.

Bang for the buck",True,0,0,,"{70124=I will be enrolled in Jan 2013 so I'm not familiar with UNCC unusual tradition yet. I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

The Bistro is a more fancy type of eat in place which has really good food as well, and you can also use your meal swipes there too. The other places of interest that UNCC has to offer is a Chik Fila, Bojangles, Subway, Salsaritas, and Grill Nation. Students have the option to use meal plans or declining balance. The fast food places only use declining balance, and places like Crown commons and Bistro can use both.', 'One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends.', 'The academics here at UNCC are extraordinary. The professors here are very nice and understanding, and will generally be happy to help you on anything you have trouble with. Each professor has a strong desire in teaching to their students the knowledge they have gained over their lifetime. Not only will you look up to these teachers for advice, but once you get to know them they also will become like a friend to you. The professors here really know what they are talking about and i have never once questioned there teaching regarding if it was wrong or right. The grading system at this school is genuinely fair to students and the amount of work given is acceptable.', 'Students who are considering on applying to UNCC should first get know what the campus is all about. UNCC offers SOAR programs which gives you a in depth tour of campus life and all the facilities it has to offer.', 'The University of North Carolina at Charlotte is a very diverse and well rounded school that greets its students with open arms. The faculty and students here are easy to communicate to, and will have an open mind to your questions and answers. I am glad to call myself a forty-niner because we represent our school as one community.']]",University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-North-Carolina-at-Charlotte/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/58125,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,198,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00201-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,908957295,908795961,HORIZONTAL,,"06/09/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

I did go to UNCC Global festival this year. I found the event is amazing. It give the opportunity for students and public to know different culture from all over the world. Beautiful performances accompany by delicious international food., 435848=We have a Culture Club, and activites such as a upcoming football team in 2013, 705017=UNC Charlotte is a medium-sized school, with a friendly staff and student population and a beautiful green campus which is unexpected from a campus so close to such a major urban hotspot as Charlotte. UNCC has a ton of school spirit, which will only grow with the introduction of football in the fall of 2013. UNCC is home to many award-winning and world-renowned faculty, and I am proud to be attending., 36062=Charlotte offers its in-state residence around 2000 a semester and out of state is around 8000., 55903=If you are certain that you want to attend this college, be sure to apply super early. The early admission deadline is in October (I think it's October 5). If you apply early you can be eligible for merit aid and UNCC has a lot of merit aid., 719652=I loved my dorm life, although I know live off campus. My roommates are the girls I met in the dorms. The dorms are small, but they are building brand new dorms for the upcoming 2013-2014 school year which is going to be amazing because the dorm I stayed in was outdated...Otherwise GREAT!, 137019=This school is an exceptional learning opportunity with a beautiful campus. There are always events going on and free prizes. Most of the buildings are new and the rest is kept clean in 2013 we will have a football team!, 390019=I am a transfer student coming from the University of North Carolina at Pembroke. However, I truly have a great vibe about the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, because I have visited numerous times and each time I love it even more! The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013.

There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus.

There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus.

UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

The Summer of 2010 I attended this law program at UNCC and I just feel that there is more opportunity there to fully fulfill my desires in completing my degree in Pre-Law., 897447=Tuition, both instate and out of state, is relatively low when compared to universities of its caliber. It is ranked third in the top colleges in the UNC system, only behind NC State and Chapel Hill. It is an ever expanding college, expected to enroll 35000 students by 2020, while Chapel Hill is projected to enroll 33000 by the same time. My major is engineering, and upon discussing preferred majors from different engineering firms around North Carolina, the only engineering degrees most consider come from UNCC or NC State. All others get thrown out. The education at Charlotte is of high quality and a low cost and low hype., 346190=The University of North Carolina is a very beautiful school, with many buildings, an awesome student union, and a decent gym. The teachers are decent, depending on you get, some will help a lot more than others. The school will be getting a football team in 2013, but the basketball games are fun!, 38596=The University of North Carolina at Charlotte has a home atmosphere. It is on a beautiful 1000 acre land located near Concord. It is only 10 minutes away from the city., 44060=I am an out of state student which means I have to pay a lot more than in-state students. Tuition is very good compared to a lof of other schools. We have Division I NCAA basketball teams and a ver good soccer team. It is worth it to watch winning sports teams. Charlotte is also getting its first football team Fall of 2014., 575035=Its a modern school, especially the engineering college. It also is getting a football team in 2013. A school that should not be overlooked., 870492=One of the best features about this campus is dorm life. UNCC offers a variety of different housing to accommodate your stay. For incoming freshman i would suggest either a high-rise dorm or lynch hall. The high-rises are probably one of the best places the campus has to offer where you can meet new people. Each room will have you and another roommate, each given your own bed, closet, and desk. Each floor has four public bathrooms with multiple showers and toilets, so you will never have a concern for privacy. The high-rise also will accommodate a new dining hall in Fall 2014 which by the looks of it it looks phenomenal. Another good housing option for freshman is Lynch hall. Each dorm has four occupants given there own separate room. However all of the four occupants must share a bathroom and shower. This is an ideal spot if you like to have a bit more privacy. This building is located right next to the student union and is close to all the academic buildings, so it is not a hassle to walk to class everyday. Lynch also is a great place to make friends., 868633=They are all kinds of activities you can do around campus. There are numerous clubs you can join, and intramural activities you can play on as a team. Also the student union has a movie theater which if your a student you can get into for free. UNCC is now newly home to the Charlotte 49ers football team which just kicked off its first inaugural game Fall 2013. The basketball and soccer games are really cool to go to as well., 596392=At this school, I feel like you truly get what you pay for as far as academics and student life goes..and it'll be more worth it once football starts in Fall 2013. For all this school has to offer for under $20,000, I think it's a great place to be, 214055=The college has great overall quality in terms of all educational departments. The college lies within a great a wonderful city full of many compelling extra-curricular activities. The college also has a good sports organization. However, they lack a football team until the year of 2013., 612882=There is always something going on on campus! Basketball games are popular, and starting Fall 2013 Niner Football will be here! The National Whitewater Rafting Center is close by, as well as Crowder's Mountain State Park for those who like hiking and other outdoor activities. If you like going out on the town, Downtown Charlotte is a short drive away from the University and party buses regularly go from campus to various nightclubs., 51055=Something is always going on, on campus you just have to be willing to get involved. There are hundreds of clubs to choose from and several sports teams (including club/intramural). Football will be coming fall of 2013, 925883=Ã‚Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 508555=UNC Charlotte is a rapidly growing University. Additional buildings are shooting up daily as the prospective Fall 2013 football stadium is nearing a finish. As of now, UNC Charlotte is primarily a commuter school. However, in the next few years I expect to see this drastically change as we form one team for Charlotte, NC., 677583=The campus is located in the midst of 1000 acres of wooded area. There are some cool trails to walk and bike and the campus even as its own Botanical Garden that tourist enjoy coming to see., 692196=There are very few times which students feel unsafe on the campus. There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC *“…Hº¥zÊJ¾ï“$à2gÍ–(tµwNó”íais actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

There are many emergency lights/buttons around the campus. There is also safe ride which runs until 2:00 AM, if a student calls the bus will pick them up and transport them to any place on campus. There is also a large population of police on campus., 96667=Since I became a UNCC student in August of 2009, I have learned a great deal. In addition to the daily rigors of academic life that being a student at UNCC brings, I have learned how to adjust from a small, private high school to an enormous (by comparison) public college. Perhaps the most important thing that I already knew and my experience at UNCC has confirmed is the importance of getting involved in campus life. In order to get something out of it, one must in turn put something into it, and in no arena have I seen this fact validated more than in my experience at UNCC., 611595=UNC Charlotte hosts all kinds of events throughout the year, though I don't think any of them are particularly unusual. We host a 5K run in February, Feisty's holds a hot dog eating challenge, and there is a semi-annual international party held in the student union welcoming the international students each semester. We also hold service events such as the day when we make 1,000 sandwiches for the homeless, and blood drives., 850009=I am a commuter because i live close to campus but i've heard dorm life is fun. My friends who live on campus say they have made a lot of friends that live in their dorm. They say that they enjoy the closeness of everything because they live on campus. Also, there are many options to housing and off campus living. UNCC is actually building new off campus housing to be ready for the 2014-2015 school year., 220108=The campus encourages everyone to take precautions. If it is late and dark outside, one can call safe ride, which will come pick one up and take one to their desired destination. It runs until 2:30 am. Also there are poles with blue lights that are like a tracking device. If one is in a dangerous situation, then one just touches the button and the police are able to track where one is at and come provide assistance., 335657=Classes can be hard, especially chemistry. Don't let them demoralize you, although it can seem like they were designed to be that way. Adapt to each professor's teaching style. Keep up with your classes. Engineering program is extremely frustrating in 1201, but once you get through that you get to play with lathes and mills. Math department has pretty good teachers, can't say the same for physics., 110410=There is great security on this campus. There are lit up emergency poles through out the campus. You will always see campus police riding around. At night there is Safe Ride transportation to get you to your destination safely. It runs from 4:30 pm-2:30 am, and you can just call it whenever you need it between those hours.}"

A variety of selection criteria and sort options are available. DATA SOURCES The structure and financial data sources used in the preparation of the publication are: Annual Reports of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 1934 - current Assets and Liabilities, Commercial and Mutual Savings Banks, 1934 - 1983 Bank Operating Statistics, 1968 - 1983 FDICÃ¯Â¿Â½s Research Information System (RIS), 1984 Ã¯Â¿Â½ current The primary sources of financial data for the publications listed above are the Reports of Income and Condition submitted by FDIC-insured institutions to the Federal commercial bank regulators and the Thrift Financial Reports submitted by the FDIC-insured savings institutions that were regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision(1984-2011). Structure data are based on information contained in the FDIC financial institution structure data base (SIMS). METHODOLOGY",True,0,0,,"{34246=Estimated Loss The estimated loss is the difference between the amount disbursed from the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) to cover obligations to insured depositors and the amount estimated to be ultimately recovered from the liquidation of the receivership estate. Estimated losses reflect unpaid principal amounts deemed unrecoverable and do not reflect interest that may be due on the DIF's administrative or subrogated claims should its principal be repaid in full. Notes: Comprehensive data on estimated losses are not available for FDIC-insured failures prior to 1986, or for FSLIC-insured failures from 1934-88. Estimated loss is presented as Ã¯Â¿Â½N/AÃ¯Â¿Â½ in years for which comprehensive information is not available. Estimated Loss data was previously referred to as Ã¯Â¿Â½Estimated CostÃ¯Â¿Â½ in past releases of the Historical Statistic on Banking. For RTC receiverships, the Ã¯Â¿Â½Estimated CostÃ¯Â¿Â½ included an allocation of FDIC corporate revenue and expense items such as interest expense on Federal Financing Bank debt, interest expense on escrowed funds and interest revenue on advances to receiverships. Other FDIC receiverships did not include such an allocation. To maintain consistency with FDIC receiverships, the RTC allocation is no longer reflected in the estimated loss amounts for failed / assisted institutions that were resolved through RTC receiverships. Beginning with the release of 2007 information, the Ã¯Â¿Â½Estimated LossÃ¯Â¿Â½ in the Historical Statistics on Banking is presented and defined consistently with the aggregate Estimated Receivership Loss for FRF-RTC institutions and Estimated Losses for FDIC receiverships that are reported in the FDICÃ¯Â¿Â½s Annual Report. The estimated loss is obtained from the FDICÃ¯Â¿Â½s Failed Bank Cost Analysis (FBCA) report and the RTC Loss report. The FBCA provides data for receiverships back to 1986. The RTC Loss Report provides similar data back to 1989. Questions regarding Estimated Loss should be sent to DOFBusinessCenter@fdic.gov. Also, for more detail regarding resolution transactions and the FDIC's receivership activities, see Managing the Crisis: The FDIC and RTC Experience, a historical study prepared by the FDIC's Division of Resolutions and Receiverships. Copies are available from the FDIC's Public Information Center., 36790=Insurance Fund Before 1989, there were two federal deposit insurance funds, one administered by the FDIC, which insured deposits in commercial banks and state-chartered savings banks, and another administered by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which insured deposits in state- and federally-chartered savings associations. In 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) specified that thereafter the FDIC would be the federal deposit insurer of all banks and savings associations and would administer both the FDIC fund, which was renamed the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the replacement for the insolvent FSLIC fund, which was called the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). Although it was created in 1989, the SAIF was not responsible for savings association failures until 1996. From 1989 through 1995, savings association failures were the responsibility of the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). In February 2006, The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 provided for the merger of the BIF and the SAIF into a single Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). Necessary technical and conforming changes to the law were made under The Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Conforming Amendments Act of 2005. The merger of the funds was effective on March 31, 2006., 26058=FDIC-Insured Institutions The category of FDIC-insured commercial banks includes all commercial banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It also includes all commercial banks insured by the FDIC that are regulated by and submit financial data to one of the three Federal commercial bank regulators (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Office of the Comptroller of the Currency). The category of FDIC-insured savings institutions includes all institutions insured by the FDIC that operated under state or federal banking codes applicable to thrift institutions. Data on savings institutions that have been placed in Resolution Trust Corporation conservatorship (1989 through 1995) are not aggregated with other savings institutions, since they do not operate as privately-held entities, and their resolution costs do not accrue to the FDIC. These RTC conservatorship institutions are listed separately as memoranda items where applicable.}"
