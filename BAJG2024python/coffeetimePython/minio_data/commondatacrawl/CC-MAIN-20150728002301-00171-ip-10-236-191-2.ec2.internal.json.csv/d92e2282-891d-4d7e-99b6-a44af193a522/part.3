You cannot drive or walk through campus without seeing any cops and that is very reassuring. There are blue emergency campus phones throughout the campus and can be seen from almost anywhere. The campus also offers an escort service for late at night to those who do not want to walk alone.', 'Kent has a tremendous Greek life. It has the basic social Greek organizations as well as those geared toward certain majors as well as those for honors students. Greek life is known campus wide and makes a great impact on service in the area and getting students involved.', ""Kent has just about any club you can think of. And if it doesn't then you can make your own! Its' clubs and activities are very unique and there is something for everyone."", ""Those looking to meet new people, make an impact in others' lives and an impact in the community, those looking for a good time."", 'Kent is a great university but a little bit on the expensive side. The campus is flawless and beautiful but most of the money seems to go toward aesthetically pleasing improvements. Many of the classes and campuses could use more work and updating. Kent is fairly priced but is known to nickle and dime its students.', 'Kent does not offer much to do for fun if you are under the age of 21. However, downtown is expanding and new restaurants and buildings are being built. But Kent is a short drive from Akron and other surrounding areas that offer great places to eat and have fun. Most people go to parties for fun in Kent and if you are 21 there are great bars to visit downtown.', 'Some places on campus are hopping and delicious. I loved living in Eastway because there were tons of options for food. And same goes for the student center. But some of the other on campus stores are lackluster. A main problem is that most of the buildings offer the same selections and that is fried food. You can find a variety of foods on campus but it will prove difficult.', 'The dorms are nothing to write about but the dorm life however is great. I had some of my best times in my dorm freshman year and I remain friends with the people I met there even now. I recommend that everyone live in the dorms at least for one year.', 'I think that Kent is as hard as you make it. Some courses are known to be way tougher than others so take that into account when you register for them and are setting aside time to study. It also depends on your major. Some majors are way more intensive and time consuming than others. b v', 'Some tips for prospective students would be to live in Eastway if you are an incoming freshmen. This is an all freshmen dorm and really gives the true college experience for first year students. Another tip would be to prepare to walk long distances to class. Kent is full of green spaces which is great but also means for long walks to class, especially in the winter. A tip for commuting students would be to get to campus early. Parking is always a mess and is known to make students late to class or they are forced to park somewhere closer and may receive parking tickets. I also would recommend to join an organization. Kent is a big school and it can be easy to get lost in the crowd. Being a part of something will make your time at Kent worthwhile.', 'Kent State is a beautiful campus that offers endless opportunities for growth and learning. Kent State is one of the top schools in Northeast Ohio and definitely caters to its students. Kent has renowned programs and offers students to fulfill their full potential.']]",Kent State University Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/Kent-State-University-at-Kent/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/56975,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,170,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00171-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898095055,897931119,HORIZONTAL,"07/20/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Am learning a lot I'm currently majoring in Zoology, the professors are well educated with super communication skills. Many have great lectures but are seriously hard graders. If your nervous about getting a hard teacher check out the rate a teacher website. But dont stress, if you ever have problems with the coursework just ask your professor (most are willing to help) or check out the tutor center. Thats where I lived at. Also be aware of the T.A.'s they are still in school and just now coming into the teacher role, so most arent sure what they're doing...so just give them a break.

Am learning a lot I'm currently majoring in Zoology, the professors are well educated with super communication skills. Many have great lectures but are seriously hard graders. If your nervous about getting a hard teacher check out the rate a teacher website.

Am learning a lot I'm currently majoring in Zoology, the professors are well educated with super communication skills. Many have great lectures but are seriously hard graders. If your nervous about getting a hard teacher check out the rate a teacher website. But dont stress, if you ever have problems with the coursework just ask your professor (most are willing to help) or check out the tutor center. Thats where I lived at. Also be aware of the T.A.'s they are still in school and just now coming into the teacher role, so most arent sure what they're doing...so just give them a break.

Also be aware of the T.A.'s they are still in school and just now coming into the teacher role, so most arent sure what they're doing...so just give them a break.

The non-science classes aren't very challenging and the exams overall are not tricky. With such a big class size, it is sometimes hard to learn in class, so be prepared to teach yourself the majority of the material. Tips for prospective students Try your best to attend class as it helps you focus on what will be tested on exams. Use your breaks between classes wisely; try studying in the library instead of talking to your friends for the whole hour break. Keep up with you studies and try not to fall behind.

The campus provides a mix of frat boys and sorority girls as well as the typical UNH partyer stereotype. There is also the hippy stereotype as well as stoners and boys on longboards. It is also not uncommon to witness people walking on tightropes tied between two trees in front of the library or girls sunbathing outside of their dorm. This may be one of the reasons to why I enjoy college as much as I do. So really, UNH fits all types of students, and everyone will be able to find a niche even if it takes a little time.', ""Although at the end of senior year I wanted to have another year of high school, if I could have known then that college would be this amazing I wouldn√¢\x80\x99t have been nervous about moving on. If I could talk to my high school self, I would have told her that it only gets better. I would have told myself that college is a new life with new people and you will become so close to the people you meet at school that even though they were strangers when you first met them they are now family. So don√¢\x80\x99t be nervous, and don√¢\x80\x99t be afraid to talk to anyone because everyone is just as nervous as you are. As for finding your way around, it's not as hard as it looks. I promise :)"", ""I can't lie and say I always wanted to go to UNH. Truth is what impacted my decision to go there was the money. UNH was my in-state safety school and it is a GREAT price for the education. UNH has all the fun you could want as well as a huge selection of classes which will let you try everything you want."", 'As cheesy as it sounds I could be happier at UNH. Durham is more of a college town than I ever could have expected, big enough that you will never be able to meet everyone who you go to school with but small enough that you can feel a camaraderie with students around you. You√¢\x80\x99re all wildcats and the football and hockey games are amazing (even if your not into sports). . It is close to Boston and Portsmouth, and has an Amtrac station on campus making traveling near or far no fuss; but even though you can basically go anywhere, I have had no desire to leave campus other than a trip or two to the mall since I arrived on campus. I also can√¢\x80\x99t lie, weekends at UNH are pretty fun. There is always something to do, and the University tries hard to provide entertainment. Even without this entertainment, UNH is known as a party school and this emerges on the weekend, where areas of campus stay awake all night. I doubt i√¢\x80\x99ll ever leave because I don√¢\x80\x99t know what I√¢\x80\x99ll do if I can√¢\x80\x99t see UNH decked out in blue and white on homecoming weekend.', ""I am learning a ton at UNH, but I can't say it's all academic. Part of the college experience is learning how to interact with people and ways to meet new people. This is at times even more important than some classes. Even as I say this I have learned a lot in my classes. Your freshman year will help you decide what you want to keep studying and pursue, versus what you thought you wanted.

Unlike high school where you can have the same class every day, College gives you the luxury of having a class 2-4 times per week. Some classes require me to read & analyze articles, others look for a 6-8 page paper. For those that do neither, the classes require a total of three exams and a final exam that help/hurt your grade if you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt study.

If you took a lecture hall class (100-200 students) at 8 am in the morning, and you fall asleep, your teacher would remember you for that. Unless you go to their office to chat, it will be hard for them to know which kind of person you are. Unlike high school where you can have the same class every day, College gives you the luxury of having a class 2-4 times per week. Some classes require me to read & analyze articles, others look for a 6-8 page paper. For those that do neither, the classes require a total of three exams and a final exam that help/hurt your grade if you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt study. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm a little biased but I really like classes in the Liberal Arts field. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm undeclared but trying to get into Sociology and Justice Studies. If I graduate with both, I can still go into Law School. My previous major, Nursing, did not give me the same opportunity, but I guess your major reflects what you√¢¬Ä¬ôre passionate about.

So it's kind of a cool mix that you get to choose from on your application. My roommate and I decided to go with the freshman dorm because we want to get acquainted with people who are going through the same things and dealing with the same things we are, as well as meet new people. And we heard that the freshman dorms sometimes have fun outings and trips to the city, like Boston and such, so that should be cool."", ""I haven't actually attended UNH yet, but I heard that the course load is pretty decent. I suppose it depends on your teacher and their teaching techniques (as well as how you learn!). It's definitely not like high school where you're writing 5-7 page papers, there might be times when professors would like a 3 page personal story or a 15 page essay on something you know nothing about. So I'm going to guess that the academic rigor is definitely challenging, but not overwhelming."", ""I would definitely say to pick up a campus map because the campus is so big. Of course, once you get here it's going to be easy and it's going to seem so simple, but for an incoming freshman, it can seem daunting. I would just talk to as many upper class kids as you can and do not hesitate to contact admissions via e-mail or calling them to ask questions about orientation, placement tests, roommate assignments, etc. because they are there to help!

It's a great way to meet new people and I've had some of my favorite conversations in there."", 'UNH is expensive, and this is no secret to anybody. The faculty understand that students are paying huge amounts of money to attend and they try their best to make it worth every penny.', 'UNH supports huge concerts of popular artists such as J.

There is a $2 movie theater showing movies from only a few months before, they hire professional jugglers, hypnotists, and entertainers, and there is a comedy show almost every week. There is always something to do for fun.', ""UNH's food is world-class. There are three dining halls, each open all day, which serve excellent buffet-style meals as well as provide dry foods like breads, bagels, and cereals so students may make their own meals if they feel so inclined. Beyond that are several small food courts, restaurants, and convenient stores, from which students can buy food using their own money or the specialized Dining Dollars and Cat's Cache that come with certain meal plans. If a student is still unsatisfied, there are several small restaurants just off campus as well as a grocery store."", ""UNH's themed housing creates small communities within the campus-wide population. Living in the Making the Grade themed dorm, I felt myself surrounded by others with similar interests in all of my fields of study as well as my hobbies and past times."", 'UNH has many resources for all levels of students. Students have access to a number of help centers for general areas, such as the Writing Center, which is an office dedicated to helping students of any discipline with essays. Some of these are placed strategically in certain dorms: the Math Center, for example, is located in one of the large Freshmen-only towers, as it is most frequently visited by new students.', 'Get involved and meet new people. Obviously this has its social benefits and merits, but do not forget that peers and professors alike can be an unprecedented help during your academic career.', 'The University of New Hampshire provides academic, social, career, and research opportunities and support for all areas of study. The campus itself is very welcoming and boasts an exceptionally accepting atmosphere. Students looking to learn new things in an environment dedicated to education will find UNH to be a perfect fit for them.']]",University of New Hampshire (UNH) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-New-Hampshire-Main-Campus/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/85337,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,49,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00171-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898260943,898151323,HORIZONTAL,"07/09/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 12 people found this review useful. 1 of 119 Funmi from Harvard, MA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Emergency Blue Lights are well dispersed, the university has a dedicated, accredited police department of its own, and new developments are always in progress, such as text notifications of possible concerns and the CrimePush iPhone app recently invented by a UNH student and implemented by local police departments. If anything, local police departments are known more for being overbearing than for letting crime occur. Serious incidents are well-publicized but infrequent.', 'Greek Life is what you make it at UNH. Students may participate in a good number of fulfilling, upstanding, chivalry-touting organizations that are part of the association, which provides great resources and opportunities to participants. However, each year it seems at least one frat becomes unrecognized, though usually their reputation for trouble is clearly established by that point. Nonetheless, choosing the right fraternity or sorority for you can build all of the lasting relationships and experiences that you desire.', ""Not only is the list of student organizations staggering, but the administration does an excellent job of supporting them, allowing participants to forge experiences in leadership, entertainment, marketing their club, and more that will serve them well in any future endeavors. Of particular popularity are the campus' six a cappella groups (one, Not Too Sharp, recently dubbed 'Best of NH'), which hold yearly auditions, the student theater troupe Mask and Dagger or the Theater and Dance Department, reputable student media outlets The New Hampshire (newspaper) and WUNH (Class A FM radio), and the intramural sports teams, which include every traditional recreational sport plus other favorites like Broomball. Students may also choose clubs that go straight to the resume, such as the Athletic Trainers Club, athletics marketing club, or the Student Committee on Popular Entertainment (SCOPE), which brings in large music and comedy acts each semester (recently including J. Cole, Eli Young Band, Passion Pit, and Lewis Black)."", 'Students seeking a large student body but a rural campus will thrive here. The natural world is close at hand here, so active or outdoors-oriented individuals will enjoy the setting. Motivated, entrepreneurial students will especially find the opportunity to carve a promising future for themselves at UNH.', ""Hockey. Wildcats fans are irrepressible, and a yearly trip to the playoffs means they are not going anywhere. The student section at any big game is the most fun place on campus, and visiting teams had better be ready for a long list of traditional irreverent cheers and taunts. An improving football team is rapidly gaining 'tradition' status, and 'riding the Wildcat' statue pictures are completely unavoidable."", ""Due largely to recent lack of support from state government, UNH is one of the nation's most expensive state universities, particularly for out-of-state students. However, its strength and variety offerings may make it comparable to some private schools, where its price compares favorably. Based on growing enrollment rates, the price seems to be worthwhile!"", ""On campus, the Memorial Union Building provides movies in their theaters and live entertainment of some kind most nights of the week. Student organizations such as the a cappella, instrumental, or electronic music groups, student theater troupe, comedy clubs, and intramural sport teams provide opportunities for entertainment or participation. Durham's quaint downtown provides food and bars but not much entertainment, but outdoors-oriented students will find that forests, rivers, trails, and winding waterfront roads offer great recreation. Moving further away, neighboring towns Dover, Newington and Portsmouth offer local culture and all forms of typical entertainment, and beaches, mountains, and Boston are all accessible with an hour's commute."", ""The campus' three dining halls are well-placed, and the availability of food is exceptionally good.

The Housing department does an thorough job of placing freshmen in situations that meet their needs and whims. Though the condition of buildings and rooms varies, nearly every dorm has individuals who love it, reflecting a good overall experience.', 'You can build an academic schedule that fits your own expectations here. Although finaigling an easy list of courses is always possible, the average student will progress to having a few very challenging courses per year by halfway through their degree. Students interested in the extra challenge of a self-created research project will find the academic infrastructure, grant support, and presentation opportunities are readily available.', 'UNH has the student body size and variety of opportunities for you to write your own story- if you are looking for a particular social or academic experience you can find it here. However, often you will have to go out and find it yourself, so having an idea of what you are looking for and having the ability to advocate for yourself will serve you well.', 'UNH offers a gorgeous rural campus that provides the best of New England living. Academic opportunities abound from agriculture to business, communications to neuroscience, with a faculty well-positioned to support student research opportunities in any program. Diverse extracurricular activities include a thriving a cappella and instrumental music scene, excellent student media such as the newspaper and WUNH radio, constant entertainment in the Memorial Union Building, and a well organized Greek Life program.']]",University of New Hampshire (UNH) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-New-Hampshire-Main-Campus/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/85337,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,50,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00171-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898260943,898151323,HORIZONTAL,"07/09/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 12 people found this review useful. 1 of 119 Funmi from Harvard, MA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Tips for prospective students Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to ask for help. Make use of CFAR, and other academic resources that are free. Don't wait until the last two weeks of classes to try and salvage your grade, get help the second you start struggling. Bang for the buck All I have to say is pic your classes based on the prof. and make use of ratemyprofessor.com, classes are the hardest when you have a professor you can't stand. Am enjoying being here At first UNH was intimidating for me and wasn't even in my top 5 collages and yet their curriculum was just as good as all the other schools that I was looking at. The nicest thing is that UNH is small enough that you can get to where you need to be in a timely fashion and yet still big enough that you find your own niche in the society.

The dining crew does tend to get lazy close to breaks though, so you see food quality go down a little bit. Best times to eat are the off hours of the day, so either before or after peak meal times. This will save you from rushing in the dining hall and choosing the automatic unhealthy choices that are quick and easy to grab. Very friendly staff that are always willing to do whatever it is you ask, especially if you have an allergy or preference.', ""Every year I have lived in the dorms I have loved it.

You can even find work study jobs that cater to your major as well (as a pre-vet major I work in the NH State Diagnostic Lab on campus with veterinarians and get to observe interactive necropsies (animal autopsies) where the vets ask for your ideas and opinions and it's ok to say I don't know because they'll fill you in.

If you took a lecture hall class (100-200 students) at 8 am in the morning, and you fall asleep, your teacher would remember you for that. Unless you go to their office to chat, it will be hard for them to know which kind of person you are. Unlike high school where you can have the same class every day, College gives you the luxury of having a class 2-4 times per week. Some classes require me to read & analyze articles, others look for a 6-8 page paper. For those that do neither, the classes require a total of three exams and a final exam that help/hurt your grade if you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt study. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm a little biased but I really like classes in the Liberal Arts field. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm undeclared but trying to get into Sociology and Justice Studies. If I graduate with both, I can still go into Law School. My previous major, Nursing, did not give me the same opportunity, but I guess your major reflects what you√¢¬Ä¬ôre passionate about.

Tips for prospective students Trust your instincts and don't be afraid to ask for help. Make use of CFAR, and other academic resources that are free. Don't wait until the last two weeks of classes to try and salvage your grade, get help the second you start struggling. Bang for the buck All I have to say is pic your classes based on the prof. and make use of ratemyprofessor.com, classes are the hardest when you have a professor you can't stand. Am enjoying being here At first UNH was intimidating for me and wasn't even in my top 5 collages and yet their curriculum was just as good as all the other schools that I was looking at.

Probably 85% of the UNH student body is from NH. The out of state tuition is a little outrageous for this school unless you are going into the engineering program.', ""Durham is a very rural area, so there isn't much to do. Most UNH students party in their free time, but there are many many clubs to join for fun. There's even a hammock club and a juggling club! Downtown Durham on the edge of campus has some cute coffee shops and a pizza place to hang out in, but that's about it."", ""The food at UNH is amazing. There's a sushi bar, omelet bar, stir fry bar, endless cereal, all day waffles--anything, you name it. The nice thing about these dining halls is that you swipe a card and you can eat, and create, anything you want for as long as you want! Other schools make students pay for individual items like a grocery store, but at UNH it's like having your own endless kitchen."", ""Dorm life really depends on your personality. If you love the party life, staying up until 2 a.m. every night and hiding alcohol under your bed then there are abundant places for you to live (i.e. Stoke, Williamson, Christainson). There are also themed living for all of us other people, which is really nice. There is a chem free dorm (no alcohol or drugs), honors dorm, sports lovers dorm, leadership dorm and music dorm. As a freshman there's a large chance you will end up in a place with puke covered floors and very loud neighbors, but it is easy to find a nice place to live and switch into it once on campus."", 'UNH definitely is not the hardest school out there, but your determination level will reflect your education when you graduate. If you want to breeze by and learn nothing, showing minima effort then you most definitely can. There is also the opportunity to really challenge yourself for a quality education if you seek that as well.', ""Though UNH isn't an Ivy League school, prepare to work for your grade.

If you took a lecture hall class (100-200 students) at 8 am in the morning, and you fall asleep, your teacher would remember you for that. Unless you go to their office to chat, it will be hard for them to know which kind of person you are. Unlike high school where you can have the same class every day, College gives you the luxury of having a class 2-4 times per week. Some classes require me to read & analyze articles, others look for a 6-8 page paper. For those that do neither, the classes require a total of three exams and a final exam that help/hurt your grade if you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt study.

If you took a lecture hall class (100-200 students) at 8 am in the morning, and you fall asleep, your teacher would remember you for that. Unless you go to their office to chat, it will be hard for them to know which kind of person you are. Unlike high school where you can have the same class every day, College gives you the luxury of having a class 2-4 times per week. Some classes require me to read & analyze articles, others look for a 6-8 page paper. For those that do neither, the classes require a total of three exams and a final exam that help/hurt your grade if you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt study. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm a little biased but I really like classes in the Liberal Arts field. I√¢¬Ä¬ôm undeclared but trying to get into Sociology and Justice Studies. If I graduate with both, I can still go into Law School. My previous major, Nursing, did not give me the same opportunity, but I guess your major reflects what you√¢¬Ä¬ôre passionate about. If you√¢¬Ä¬ôre good at Art, Science, History, Technology, or care about animals, you have the chance to major in that field and turn it into a career.

Such as HoCo (no we are not talking about Hollister Company) we are talking about Holloway Commons, our largest dining hall. Once you get on campus you immerse yourself in the culture of college.', ""ANYTHING (within legal limitations)! Just next door to UNH we have Dover and Portsmouth, two amazing places to visit and shop, grab dinner, go out, movies, almost anything! But if that doesn't get you excited this should! UNH has it's own Amtrak stop right on campus next to our dairy barn! You can take the train up north into Maine or down to Boston, and not only is it convenient it is also within reason financially! Also if you love to go down to Boston a lot Amtrak offers 6-tixs which is essentially 6 one way tickets either to Boston or from Boston back to Durham, at a reduced cost than buying the tickets separately."", 'UNH food and dining is one of the top in New England! UNH has three dining halls equally spread across campus making it convenient for students to access them. Also with adjusted hours and services for students. Also our largest dining hall (Holloway Commons) throws some theme dinners as well. This past year we had a Harry Potter one, which was a huge hit! It had lines all the way out of the dining hall. Also the food is amazing, and the menu gets switched enough for you to never be bored of the same old stuff.', ""Dorm life is spectacular! Depending on which dorm you live in also offers a variety of types of living. For my experience I have lived in a relatively small dorm of about 150 residents and it felt like a home; where I am able to express myself and feel safe. My dorm also offered socials where the RA's (Residential Assistants) gathered residents and did fun games and dances and contests. The rooms are equally amazing offering space and comfort (depending dorm to dorm). If you do however ever have a problem you are always able to go to an RA or RHD (Residential Hall Director) or if the problem escalates you could go to housing to potentially work something out. UNH is there to make you feel safe and want to make you happy with your living situations."", ""The academics of UNH can range, as they do with most institutions.

UNH is also a wonderful and greatly credited institution. With many great professors and adjusting to new demands and needs of the University. UNH is able to provide a lot for many. If you're looking at attending the University of New Hampshire and live outside New Hampshire; UNH is a great school. Accreditation of the school is great and is very organized; each department working to make every student feel as if they know what they will graduate with and are able to help with many things that may arise during your time at UNH. The campus is simply put, everything you could want; UNH lies right in the town of Durham and is surrounded by Portsmouth and Dover, two places where you can go for any type of fun. However if you want that more city feeling don't you worry, UNH has an Amtrak stop right on campus next to our very own dairy barn! UNH is a very active community as well, always having some sporting event going on or concert or speaker. Everyone at UNH does get involved and it makes it seem like a huge family; though you may not know every single person."", ""The University of New Hampshire (Main Campus, Durham) is a wonderful place to meet a ton of new people, have amazing opportunities thrown at you, and still be able to feel at home. With my experience at UNH I have gained insight to the rigors of classes and demands of multitasking through university, but still always find time to have fun with friends. The surrounding area is also just as fun, with public transit being able to bring you there if you don't have a car; UNH is truly an amazing place where memories are formed and brains grow.""]]",University of New Hampshire (UNH) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-New-Hampshire-Main-Campus/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/85337,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,94,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00171-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,898260943,898151323,HORIZONTAL,"07/09/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 12 out of 12 people found this review useful. 1 of 119 Funmi from Harvard, MA Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

The dorm life at UNH is great, I would definitely suggest living in a freshman dorm for the first year, that way you can meet new freshman, who are going through the same transition as you.

If you're in a double/triple, don't be afraid to hang with more people than just your roomate on move in day. If you're in a single, don't be afraid to go out in the lounges, make the most of your shared space with your fellow dorm mates. 2) Don't bring everything you own to college. There's no need. UNH provides almost everything you could ask for. Snacks? Go to late night or grab a meal to go at the dining halls. Printing? Go to the library. TV? Go to the lounges in your dorm. Microwave/fridge? Go to the in dorm kitchenettes. Microwaves, stoves, fridges, sinks. It's all there for you to use. 3) Don't judge people. Everyone is definitely crazy on your first day at college. Get to know everyone once they're all settled in and more comfortable being themselves before you pass them off as friends. The person you think is stuck up and crazy may end up being your best friend by the end of the first year."", ""The University of New Hampshire has been nothing less than a place that I consider my second home. It's the one place where being a freshman is considered better than being a senior because the upperclassmen know that you still have 3 more years to be there when they're graduating.

This may be handy if the upstream Internet connections aren't working or you locked yourself out by accident. Please don't dial out on the modem, it costs money. Inbound calls on that circuit are free. The modem is a US Robotics 56K Corporate Analog Modem. If you don't have a modem in your computer, you might be able to call it using your mobile phone. Just tether your phone to your computer like you normally would, but call our modem instead of calling the number to start the tethering connection. The modem has its remote access feature enabled. Read the manual for details. IP PDU There is an IP PDU (model ""IP 9258"") at 172.30.0.7 which can be used to power cycle some of the devices in Susan the Rack. To change the state of the power ports, you'll need to telnet in and run ""setpower=11000000"". Each index represents a port, ""1"" is on and ""0"" is off. Port 1 sometimes doesn't turn on unless you use the web interface, and it might take a couple requests. Just keep clicking the apply button until it looks like power has been applied.
