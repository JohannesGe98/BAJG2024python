Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students! If you need help in the subject and want to talk to your professor, do not think that they are going to make time for you without properly signing up for a meeting with them.

Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students! If you need help in the subject and want to talk to your professor, do not think that they are going to make time for you without properly signing up for a meeting with them.

Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students! If you need help in the subject and want to talk to your professor, do not think that they are going to make time for you without properly signing up for a meeting with them.

Before choosing a class, research the professor on ratemyprofessor.com and determine their teaching style, likability, relatability and whether the textbook is necessary for the class. After you enroll in a class, take advantage of the professor's office hours and attend SI (tutoring) sessions to increase your overall grade in the class. It is also important to remember that this university also contains a twenty-four hour room available for work and study throughout the entirety of the week."", 'When getting a fresh start and entering the life of a university, it is best to keep an open mind and learn how to balance work, your studies, family, friends and fun! A great individual is one who is well- rounded and balanced in all that they do! Also, take advantage of all services that the university offers because every resource is helpful to any and every situation you will be in!', 'The University of Rhode Island is a diverse and adventure-filled university that offers a variety of majors and activities for a variety of people. It is a place where people get to live among one another and meet new people, as well as remain nearby old friends.

Compared to high school cafeterias these dining halls are five star restaurants."", ""URI has the typical college dorms, they're nothing to brag about but they could be way worse. Typically for freshman you will be in a triple with two other roommates with bunk beds. It isn't a huge room so don't get your hopes up on having a lot of space, but it is livable and I assure you after the first week you will completely be used to it. They do have very hollow walls unfortunately, I could hear my neighbors cough when they were sick during the winter for example that's probably the worst part. You will also have to share 4 showers and bathrooms amongst around 20 other people. They aren't co-ed though so girls will be with girls and boys with boys. They will be messy people do puke everywhere and miss the toilet, it happens you'll get used to it. The bright side is dorm life only gets better after freshman year. URI does offer apartments with your own kitchen and bathroom, so suck it up for one year and you won't regret it. The good thing about freshman dorms is that's where you meet all new people in your hall and make all new friends. The first month or so your dorm building does have activities so you meet everyone and get acquainted believe me it helps make a lot of new friends."", ""URI has it's range of difficult and challenging courses just like any other university. Regardless if you consider the class challenging or not, the work load will be excessive. Professors will decide to have you write papers several times a week, you will have random quizzes, and be given extensively long tests on material the teacher didn't even teach you; you actually need to read the books! That's the key factor in being successful in most classes at URI, you MUST read the material on your own because the professors WILL expect you to know it. Now not all classes are like that you will be given a syllabus for each class at the beginning of each semester so you will know what you will be getting yourself into. Most professors are straight forward and set their expectations right away. Live by the syllabus and you'll have no problems. Just remember you're not in high school anymore, they will NOT accept anything late believe me I know this by personal experiences."", ""URI is a huge campus located on a hill. Each class requires a good ten minute walk from one to another, so if the outdoors and daily exercise isn't your thing I STRONGLY suggest visiting the campus before making any decisions. Once you've officially decided URI is for you, DO NOT lose focus of your main goal at URI. You are going there to study and learn, NOT party. I must admit there will be a lot of social gatherings but you must stay on top of your school work and stay focused. It is VERY easy to fall behind in class, just by missing on day of class. You won't have your parents or professors nagging you to do your work or go to class and you will be tempted to party over studying. Biggest mistake you can make, URI does NOT play games they will quickly put you on academic probation and will not hesitate by any means to kick you out, I have seen it happen on several occasions. If you are falling behind or need help, seek it. Your professors and advisor want you to succeed, so use all of the resources you're paying for at URI."", 'The University of Rhode Island is a very diverse and accepting campus. They have an extraordinary variety and range of classes, students, and organizations/sports/clubs to suite any race,ethnicity, orientation, and interest of any student. You may be one out of a thousand at URI, but they make an effort to make your voice stand out and be important.']]",University of Rhode Island (URI) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Rhode-Island/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/92232,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,48,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00158-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,896728699,896628548,HORIZONTAL,"07/17/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 19 out of 19 people found this review useful. 1 of 120 Paige from Nashua, NH Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

Luckily instate tuition is more reasonable than out-of-state, but still, if you are a student who has to pay on their own plan on applying for scholarships, getting loans and hopefully some grants. Truthfully, I would consider not attending URI for my freshmen and sophomore years if money is an issue. This is because community colleges can offer the same beginning courses and you will get a similar quality of teaching. However, in junior and senior years the extra money URI will cost you might be worth it because advanced courses are likely not to be available at a local community college. And if you are opting for living on campus expect the price to rise because with it comes the meal plan which I would highly suggest getting when living on campus.

There are over 20 different sororities and fraternities on campus. Greek Life hosts many fundraising events and participates in many activities on campus to entertain the student body and raise money. All of the chapters on campus are national so they are very well known. There is a sorority or fraternity on campus for any type of student- everyone finds a group in Greek Life that they fit in with. Greek Life is huge at URI.', 'When students get involved in clubs and extracurricular activities on campus there will always be something for them to do, along with there always being new people to meet. Getting involved on campus determines how good of a time the students here will have, since it is a big University, unless students know a lot of people, the main source of fun and activities usually runs through clubs and activities that pertain to the students interests or hobbies.', 'URI is a great school for students that would like to get away from the city and be somewhat secluded, it is also a beautiful campus. Students that do not mind change or being surrounded by a lot of new people will adjust just fine here. Students must be able to keep up with their school work and should take interest in getting involved around campus.', 'There are not any unusual locations on campus and any traditions that take place usually pertain to Greek Life.', 'Many consider the school to be pricey, but from the experiences that students receive (both academically and socially) the price is most definitely worth it, if students can balance their social life and academics then the experience at URI will most definitely be that of a lifetime.', 'There are always options for entertainment on campus. There are all kinds of clubs and organizations for students to join, if they choose not to join, the clubs are always organizing concerts and events for the rest of the student body to attend. Something is always going on on campus, and even if students do not feel like staying on campus, there is a lot to do in Narragansett or Providence, which are not located very far from the campus.', 'The dining halls at URI are remarkable. Mainfaire dining hall has won many awards for the amazing food that they serve. The food served on campus is not like other college dining hall meals, many options are available to students at all times, allowing almost anything that a student would want to eat to basically be at their fingertips. Never will one feel as if they are in need of a homecooked meal because they are always available!', 'The dorms at URI are nothing to be afraid of, they are all clean and are cleaned regularly by the janitors. It is very easy to develop relationships with the majority of the people living in your dorm building as everyone is very friendly and open to meeting new people. The new residence hall that was just constructed, Hillside Hall, is absolutely gorgeous!', 'Depending on the major and the courses that are taken, classes can be very easy or rather difficult. No matter what the difficulty level of the course may be, it is important to stay devoted, no classes are beneficial if students slide through them without doing anything. The honors program is remarkable- the classes focus less on busy work, as most honors courses do not, and focus mainly on getting the students to think critically and enable them to engage in conversation and argument.', 'Since the school has a rather large number of students, future students will enjoy their time spent at URI the most if they get involved in something that interests them. But while there are many social activities, it is very important to keep devoted to classes, they are not the simplest, but they are most definitely doable.

Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students!

You can live in a dorm that has hallway bathrooms or a suite which has two rooms connected by a shared bathroom. The upper-class man dorms are very nice. They were recently updated/constructed.

Sometimes they loose internet connection, but other than that I have not heard any complaints."", ""Some of the professors I've had for my general education courses were a bit boring and just scaled at the end of the semester. The more you get up in your major, the better the academics become. The professors here at URI definite know their topic well and are very knowledgeable in their topic and how it relates to the real world."", 'Get involved! URI may seem small but if you take the time to see all it has to offer, you will meet people, you will do well in classes and your college experience will be great. College is what you make of it, and URI has many ways for you to go out of your comfort zone and succeed academically and socially.', 'This university may seem small at first, but has so much to offer academically and socially. The professors are always more than kind to help, and every one I have had are extremely happy when you go to their office hours.

There are the crazy, outgoing partiers; the studious students who are spend most of their time at the library; the indie-rocknroll kids who run the 198Ã‚Â° coffee shop; the preppy, well-dressed, perfectly manicured girls (and boys); and everyone in between. Trust me, you will find friends that will accept you just the way you are. Tips for prospective students URI is overall a great institution that can give students a good education and offer them opportunities that other colleges could not.

Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students! If you need help in the subject and want to talk to your professor, do not think that they are going to make time for you without properly signing up for a meeting with them.

Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students! If you need help in the subject and want to talk to your professor, do not think that they are going to make time for you without properly signing up for a meeting with them.

Just in my first semester I have taken Natural Resource courses from a professor who travels around the world discovering new species, Biology from a professor with over 40 years of teaching experience, and Philosophy from a professor who started her career in England and had some very interesting teaching methods. I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major. Yet, as there always will be, there were certain disappointments that included the struggle of developing a closer relationship with the professors. Because URI has such a big student body, the classes (especially freshmen classes) have on average 300 students! If you need help in the subject and want to talk to your professor, do not think that they are going to make time for you without properly signing up for a meeting with them.

The Greek houses on campus are a big step up from the dorms, and it's impossible not to form friendships when you're sharing a house with so many people."", ""There is seriously a club for everything on this campus, and even if there wasn't it's super easy to start one up. As I said before, GET INVOLVED. Find out what's going on and where, and get yourself to that spot. They have lots of activities throughout the semester so even if a weekly club isn't your thing, there's plenty to do where you can have fun and meet people."", ""Sadly for my generation, there is no such thing as a cheap education anymore. Even public colleges and universities charge an arm and a leg, and it's terrible! That being said, URI comes with a pretty hefty price tag, especially if you're from out of state. Definitely take the time to look into scholarships and apply for them. All of them. Everything helps. I have never regretted my decision to come to URI and I honestly love it so much that it makes me a little sad to think that my days here are almost done. It's been a great experience."", ""There are 2 dining halls to choose from, and the quality is about the same for both. I love the fact that if you pay (an exorbitant amount) for the dining options, it's all-you-can-eat-all-day-long. There were some days I would skip meals because I was that unimpressed with the menu items, but there were other days I would come back between every class because they had good menu items. If all else fails there's an amazing salad bar and a sandwich creation station, so you can live on that for most of the semester. You can also get dining dollars which work as a credit for coffee and snacks at various vendors."", ""The dorms aren't great. A lot of them are older, and let's face it, they're still dorms. You can end up with a double or a triple, regular or suite style, and getting the right roommates is half the battle. The rooms aren't a bad size and the furnishings are alright. I had no issues with the bathrooms once it sank in that no college would ever be the same as my house. I never saw much of the Resident Assistants, but I never needed them either."", ""Classes are hit or miss, some are very easy some are very hard. I've had my share of both and it's nice when you get an even mix of the two. I'm a junior now and I have to admit I have never had a bad professor or a pointless class. Every single one has taught me a lot and left me a better student. Always go through your syllabi during the first week of class, always ask any questions you have, and always stay on top of the homework. There's no way to fail a class if you follow those 3 rules all semester, every semester."", ""GET INVOLVED! I can't stress this enough no matter which college you choose. Try out for team sports, attend on-campus activities and clubs, and if you see someone who strikes your fancy, hold out your hand and introduce yourself. Those 4 years are going to fly by without warning, and the more involved in campus life you are, the better you experience, and the stronger your memories."", ""URI is a smaller campus, which works to your advantage. Classes are never more than a 15 minute walk in any direction, your professors know who you are and care about you, and you have a better chance at getting to know your classmates. It doesn't hurt that it's also a really pretty campus and close enough to a major city (Providence) that you can get away whenever you need to.""]]",University of Rhode Island (URI) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Rhode-Island/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/92232,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,90,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00158-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,896728699,896628548,HORIZONTAL,"07/17/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 19 out of 19 people found this review useful. 1 of 120 Paige from Nashua, NH Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

I was rarely unimpressed by my professors and there personal accomplishments, more often then not the classes were interesting and I learned an enormous amount that has helped me in choosing a major.

The possibilities are endless.', ""The University's dining halls were rated to be one of the best in the country. Every meal plan is unlimited so you can go as many times as you would like within a day.

The menus are posted online so you can look up what they are offering that day and decide what dining hall would best suit you for your dining preferences."", 'The year that I lived on the campus was probably one of the most fun years of my life. You have a great meal plan, meet tons of people, and have all the academic amenities right at your fingertips. I would greatly encourage prospective students to live on campus for at least one year.', 'I would say that the academic rigor is about the same as any basic college. However, this greatly depends on what types of courses you would be taking. For example, the biochemistry courses are way more rigorous than say a textiles merchandising class. All in all, every major is great and you receive a great education from every major offered.', 'To prospective students my adivce would be to take an array of classes. The University of Rhode Isalnd has some turly interesting classes and even if you think you know what you want your major to be, you could find a new line of interest by seeing diverse and eclectic points of views.', 'University of Rhode Island is an amazing college.

During the night they are parked around campus with their lights on so that if you are out walking they are easy to find and can help with any emergency. There are also blue call boxes all over campus and the campus is well lit. All dorms have card swipes on them and they lock at night so that only those who live in the dorm can key in.', 'Greek life is very prominent on campus, the fall and spring are filled with pledging activities. The houses are new and students tend to live there for their sophomore through senior year. There are academic sororities and fraternities offered as well for people who think a regular sorority or frat is too much work.', 'They have everything from Quiddich club to society of engineers. The clubs and activities work around your study schedule and are run by students.', 'People from small towns, looking for a quieter campus. Students who want to get involved in the community- there are a lot of club and teams available to students.', 'They have a nearly naked mile every year in early december and local businesses set up food carts and games on the quad for students during the day.', 'I really love the campus because I feel at home there. The teachers are really enthusiastic about their work and are very approachable. I am in one honors class (which I strongly recommend taking) and our class is 20 people. I have become close friends with all of my classmates, and we schedule study parties outside of class. The tuition is expensive for out of state, but they offer a lot of job opportunities and scholarships. It is definitely worth it.', 'URI is in the perfect place- less than 10 minutes from the beach, and 30 minutes from providence and newport. The campus itself offers a lot of entertainment; movies, dorm wars where different dorms compete in competitions, free skate, game nights, dances, and even video game competitions.', 'The two dining halls offer a lot of variety and options for even the pickiest of eaters. There is a stir fry bar, a home-style bar, a burger bar, a deli, and many other options. URI is currently expanding one of its dining halls so that should take care of the long lines that tend to accumulate during the day. The only thing that i wish was different is that you cant bring food outside the dining halls, so every time you are hungry you have to walk over to one.', 'I am an engineer, so we are placed in the four engineering dorms, which are some of the oldest on campus. They provide everything we need for college life but are not the hotel quality dorms that some campuses now have. Other freshmen dorms on campus are much nicer but are typically full of triples. I have not heard any horror stories about the triples, and even though students tend to complain about them at first, they get used to them and have a routine by the end of the first semester. There are not huge parties in the dorms, they usually take place off campus, so dorms are a good place to study.', 'URI pushes its students to do the best they can, and they also provide all the help you need to be the best student you can be. The classes are challenging but every course has a TA and there are second and third year students living in the freshman doors who are there solely to provide academic and social help for freshmen. They have an entire building dedicated to academic help and all the professors and TAs offer office hours and are always very approachable when you need help.', 'Make sure you visit the campus. I prefer the quiet and natural campus at URI but if you like the city it may not be for you. Also, you get to choose your professor, make sure you look them up at ratemyprofessor.com or ask a current student.', 'I rate the University of Rhode Island 4 out of 5 stars. They have excellent classes, most are small except for general courses which take a lecture form and they offer lots of opportunities on and off campus for internships and jobs. Their buildings are a little older and sometimes squished, but it adds to the charm.']]",University of Rhode Island (URI) Reviews: Student Reviews and Ratings | Cappex,,https://www.cappex.com/colleges/University-of-Rhode-Island/reviews?_escaped_fragment_=/show/92232,True,FIRST_ROW,RELATION,100,common-crawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2015-32/segments/1438042981460.12/warc/CC-MAIN-20150728002301-00158-ip-10-236-191-2.ec2.internal.warc.gz,896728699,896628548,HORIZONTAL,"07/17/2009 Reviewer is A current student here. 19 out of 19 people found this review useful. 1 of 120 Paige from Nashua, NH Check out reviews left by other students or leave your own review.

We are also currently looking for people to help with English to Japanese (or vice versa) translations and projects (see below). The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Japan Local Chapter Meeting is held in the form of seminars and lightning talks. It's an opportunity for people interested in web security to get together and exchange information and opinions in a casual and fun environment. There are no requirements in terms of skills, profession, nationality, gender or age. Anyone interested in web security is free to participate. We would like to have a chapter meeting every 3 months.

We are also currently looking for people to help with English to Japanese (or vice versa) translations and projects (see below). The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Japan Local Chapter Meeting is held in the form of seminars and lightning talks. It's an opportunity for people interested in web security to get together and exchange information and opinions in a casual and fun environment.

We are also currently looking for people to help with English to Japanese (or vice versa) translations and projects (see below). The OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Japan Local Chapter Meeting is held in the form of seminars and lightning talks. It's an opportunity for people interested in web security to get together and exchange information and opinions in a casual and fun environment. There are no requirements in terms of skills, profession, nationality, gender or age. Anyone interested in web security is free to participate. We would like to have a chapter meeting every 3 months. If you would like to speak at a chapter meeting, please read and agree to the speaker agreement and contact us.
