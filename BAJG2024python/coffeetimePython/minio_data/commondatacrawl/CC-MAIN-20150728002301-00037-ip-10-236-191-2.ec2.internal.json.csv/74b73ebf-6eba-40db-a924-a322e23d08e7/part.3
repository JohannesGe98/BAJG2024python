Bang for the buck It took only one trip to the campus to calm my parents nerves about the bill we would receive for my education at Hollins. Needless to say my parents hadn't saved for such a luxurious college selection, but after one visit to campus, one meeting with the financial aid officer and one meeting with the admissions counselor my parents too fell in love with the college I was already head over heels for. The counselors eased our mind over the financial burden and assured us the school would do their part to insure my attendence at their institution, and they certainly have kept their promise.",True,0,0,

The Commission also is proposing amendments to Regulation SBSR to apply the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of non-U.S. persons, or personnel of such non-U.S. persons' agents, that are located in the United States and to transactions effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility), along with certain related issues, including requiring registered broker-dealers (including registered security-based swap execution facilities) to report certain transactions that are effected by or through the registered broker-dealer., 58326=15 U.S. Code Ã‚Â§ 32, 33 - Repealed.

The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 14138=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting new Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Ã¢Â€ÂœRegulation SCIÃ¢Â€?) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) and conforming amendments to Regulation ATS under the Exchange Act. Regulation SCI will apply to certain self-regulatory organizations (including registered clearing agencies), alternative trading systems (Ã¢Â€ÂœATSsÃ¢Â€?), plan processors, and exempt clearing agencies (collectively, Ã¢Â€ÂœSCI entitiesÃ¢Â€?), and will require these SCI entities to comply with requirements with respect to the automated systems central to the performance of their regulated activities., 168485=On February 25, 2014, the Securities and Exchange Commission re-opened the comment period on two releases related to asset-backed securities. The Commission re-opened the comment period to permit interested persons to comment on an approach for the dissemination of potentially sensitive asset-level data. The comment period is scheduled to end on March 28, 2014. In light of public interest in providing comment on the approach, the Commission is extending the comment period until April 28, 2014 to permit interested persons additional time to analyze and comment on the approach., 55164=The Securities and Exchange Commission published a document in the Federal Register of January 8, 2014 that contained an incorrect instruction.

The asset-level information is required to be provided according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup Language (Ã¢Â€ÂœXMLÃ¢Â€?). We also are adopting rules to revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. We are also adopting new registration forms tailored to ABS offerings. The final rules also repeal the credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for ABS issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria., 64600=Title 17 published on 2014-04-01, 8777=Pursuant to Section 763(i) of Title VII (Ã¢Â€ÂœTitle VIIÃ¢Â€?) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting new rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) governing the security-based swap data repository (Ã¢Â€ÂœSDRÃ¢Â€?) registration process, duties, and core principles. The Commission is also adopting a new registration form. Additionally, the Commission is amending several of its existing rules and regulations in order to accommodate SDRs. First, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T and Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 to clarify that all filings by SDRs, including any confidential portion, and their requests for confidential treatment must be filed electronically. Second, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T by, among other things, adding a new rule that specifically applies to the electronic filing of SDRs' financial reports., 157993=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) proposes to amend Rule 17Ad-22 and add Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœClearing Supervision ActÃ¢Â€?), adopted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?). Among other things, the proposed rules would establish standards for the operation and governance of certain types of registered clearing agencies that meet the definition of a Ã¢Â€Âœcovered clearing agency.Ã¢Â€?, 102003=We are proposing amendments to our rules to implement Title V and Title VI of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the Ã¢Â€ÂœJOBS ActÃ¢Â€?). The proposed amendments would revise rules adopted under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) to reflect the new, higher thresholds for registration, termination of registration and suspension of reporting that were set forth in the JOBS Act. The proposed rules also would apply the thresholds specified for banks and bank holding companies to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the proposed amendments would revise the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, in accordance with the JOBS Act, to exclude certain securities held by persons who received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor for determining whether securities are Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? for purposes of registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g)., 163009=In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?), pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), is proposing recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers (Ã¢Â€ÂœSBSDsÃ¢Â€?) and major security-based swap participants (Ã¢Â€ÂœMSBSPsÃ¢Â€?), securities count requirements applicable to certain SBSDs, and additional recordkeeping requirements applicable to broker-dealers to account for their security-based swap and swap activities. The Commission also is proposing an additional capital charge provision that would be added to the proposed capital rule for certain SBSDs. Finally, the Commission is proposing technical amendments to the broker-dealer recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements., 44750=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting rules and providing guidance to address the application of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), to cross-border security-based swap activities. These rules and guidance in large part focus on the application of the Title VII definitions of Ã¢Â€Âœsecurity-based swap dealerÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœmajor security-based swap participantÃ¢Â€? in the cross-border context.

The proposed amendments would replace the current gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS., 14138=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) is adopting new Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Ã¢Â€ÂœRegulation SCIÃ¢Â€?) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) and conforming amendments to Regulation ATS under the Exchange Act.

The Commission re-opened the comment period to permit interested persons to comment on an approach for the dissemination of potentially sensitive asset-level data. The comment period is scheduled to end on March 28, 2014.

The Commission is also adopting a new registration form. Additionally, the Commission is amending several of its existing rules and regulations in order to accommodate SDRs. First, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T and Exchange Act Rule 24b-2 to clarify that all filings by SDRs, including any confidential portion, and their requests for confidential treatment must be filed electronically. Second, the Commission is amending Regulation S-T by, among other things, adding a new rule that specifically applies to the electronic filing of SDRs' financial reports., 157993=The Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœSECÃ¢Â€? or Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?) proposes to amend Rule 17Ad-22 and add Rule 17Ab2-2 pursuant to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?) and the Payment, Clearing, and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœClearing Supervision ActÃ¢Â€?), adopted in Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?).

The proposed rules also would apply the thresholds specified for banks and bank holding companies to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the proposed amendments would revise the definition of Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? in Exchange Act Rule 12g5-1, in accordance with the JOBS Act, to exclude certain securities held by persons who received them pursuant to employee compensation plans and establish a non-exclusive safe harbor for determining whether securities are Ã¢Â€Âœheld of recordÃ¢Â€? for purposes of registration under Exchange Act Section 12(g)., 163009=In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Ã¢Â€ÂœDodd-Frank ActÃ¢Â€?), the Securities and Exchange Commission (Ã¢Â€ÂœCommissionÃ¢Â€?), pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Ã¢Â€ÂœExchange ActÃ¢Â€?), is proposing recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers (Ã¢Â€ÂœSBSDsÃ¢Â€?) and major security-based swap participants (Ã¢Â€ÂœMSBSPsÃ¢Â€?), securities count requirements applicable to certain SBSDs, and additional recordkeeping requirements applicable to broker-dealers to account for their security-based swap and swap activities.

These rules and guidance in large part focus on the application of the Title VII definitions of Ã¢Â€Âœsecurity-based swap dealerÃ¢Â€? and Ã¢Â€Âœmajor security-based swap participantÃ¢Â€? in the cross-border context. The Commission also is adopting a procedural rule related to the submission of applications for substituted compliance.
