Tips for prospective students Don't party too hard during your first semester. I know several people who will not be able to complete their education at Howard because they were the ones getting ready every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night for the club instead of studying. Also be aware of your surroundings. Travel in large groups during the night and use the shuttles as much as possible so you won't have to worry about walking back to the dorms all the way from the metro. When you're about to buy books for classes, ask upperclassmen and look around campus for flyers of people selling their books for cheaper than the bookstore prices. Join clubs and community service organizations to build up your experience for those future internships and jobs. Stay focused on your grades. It is, after all, the reason why you'll be here in the first place so why not sit down with a friend and study!! Use your professors' office hours and sit in the front of the class. Use study groups for help before big tests and finals. There are so many libraries that you can go for quiet time and research. Lastly, have fun. The next 4 years will change your life forever.

Coming from a high school well known for its ethnic diversity, I was a bit worried that by going to an HBCU I wouldn't get that same environment, however Howard is diverse in many ways as well. A majority of the students are African American, however there are many students from around the globe, and I found the best thing was that everybody is diverse in thought, and through their experiences. Am learning a lot I have learned more in the past year at Howard than I can honestly put into words. I have learned so much about Architecture my first year that I can confidently draft floor plans and elevations of a structure, and make a decent model of it, whereas at the beginning of the year I had no idea what a drafting board was.

I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I didn't have in high school. I've learned the most in my Business Orientation class about credit and how to invest money at an earlier age. During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class. These groups helped me learn how to work with others and how to formulate certain business ideas and how to market new products. Now that my first semester is over, I'm excited to see how much Howard will teach me in the coming years.

I have learned so much about Architecture my first year that I can confidently draft floor plans and elevations of a structure, and make a decent model of it, whereas at the beginning of the year I had no idea what a drafting board was.

Tips for prospective students Don't party too hard during your first semester. I know several people who will not be able to complete their education at Howard because they were the ones getting ready every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night for the club instead of studying. Also be aware of your surroundings. Travel in large groups during the night and use the shuttles as much as possible so you won't have to worry about walking back to the dorms all the way from the metro. When you're about to buy books for classes, ask upperclassmen and look around campus for flyers of people selling their books for cheaper than the bookstore prices. Join clubs and community service organizations to build up your experience for those future internships and jobs. Stay focused on your grades. It is, after all, the reason why you'll be here in the first place so why not sit down with a friend and study!! Use your professors' office hours and sit in the front of the class. Use study groups for help before big tests and finals. There are so many libraries that you can go for quiet time and research. Lastly, have fun. The next 4 years will change your life forever.

During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class.

Tips for prospective students Don't party too hard during your first semester. I know several people who will not be able to complete their education at Howard because they were the ones getting ready every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night for the club instead of studying. Also be aware of your surroundings. Travel in large groups during the night and use the shuttles as much as possible so you won't have to worry about walking back to the dorms all the way from the metro. When you're about to buy books for classes, ask upperclassmen and look around campus for flyers of people selling their books for cheaper than the bookstore prices. Join clubs and community service organizations to build up your experience for those future internships and jobs. Stay focused on your grades. It is, after all, the reason why you'll be here in the first place so why not sit down with a friend and study!! Use your professors' office hours and sit in the front of the class. Use study groups for help before big tests and finals. There are so many libraries that you can go for quiet time and research. Lastly, have fun. The next 4 years will change your life forever.

I know several people who will not be able to complete their education at Howard because they were the ones getting ready every Thursday/Friday/Saturday night for the club instead of studying. Also be aware of your surroundings. Travel in large groups during the night and use the shuttles as much as possible so you won't have to worry about walking back to the dorms all the way from the metro. When you're about to buy books for classes, ask upperclassmen and look around campus for flyers of people selling their books for cheaper than the bookstore prices. Join clubs and community service organizations to build up your experience for those future internships and jobs. Stay focused on your grades. It is, after all, the reason why you'll be here in the first place so why not sit down with a friend and study!! Use your professors' office hours and sit in the front of the class. Use study groups for help before big tests and finals. There are so many libraries that you can go for quiet time and research. Lastly, have fun. The next 4 years will change your life forever.

I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I didn't have in high school. I've learned the most in my Business Orientation class about credit and how to invest money at an earlier age. During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class. These groups helped me learn how to work with others and how to formulate certain business ideas and how to market new products. Now that my first semester is over, I'm excited to see how much Howard will teach me in the coming years.

I took 15 credit hours for my first semester freshman year and I could handle it. There are hundreds of classes to take and what's better is that you can choose what classes you want and which teacher which is a choice that I didn't have in high school. I've learned the most in my Business Orientation class about credit and how to invest money at an earlier age. During the first semester, the School of B students are put into teams where we are given different projects and presentations that we have to present to the class. These groups helped me learn how to work with others and how to formulate certain business ideas and how to market new products. Now that my first semester is over, I'm excited to see how much Howard will teach me in the coming years.

The Copley Quad offers stellar living conditions with a meal plan included in the costs. Chestnut is good living quality as well, with included meal plan, but at a more basic level.', 'The academic aspect of classes from Park may depend on your major. The science classes are detailed and intricate, while others may be more of an easy A. Most teachers at Park are very well educated and knowledgable on all subjects, but there are some student teachers still getting the hang of it!', 'Students who anticipate coming to Park should be prepared! It is never too early to look at scholarships and financial aid. I would recommend getting your books ahead of time and working with an advisor that best fits your major to get you signed up for classes before they fill up!', 'Park has been a great portal for exposing myself and other to many new cultures.

We saw three different lion hunt and kills, a crocodile/impala kill and an unsuccessful leopard hunt in daylight.

This powerful one day course focuses on the most common web application security problems, including the OWASP Top Ten. The course will introduce and demonstrate hacking techniques, illustrating how application vulnerabilities can be exploited so students really understand how to avoid introducing such vulnerabilities into their code. Details This course starts with a module designed to raise awareness of just how insecure most web applications are.
