Jansen's powerful voice was a perfect fit for Nightwish. She was embraced immediately by their passionate fans, and was soon made a permanent member, alongside English piper Troy Donockley. Nightwish's first commercial release with Jansen was 2013's live album Showtime, Storytime, which documented their triumphant show at that year's Wacken Open Air metal festival in front of an 85,000-strong crowd. Endless Forms Most Beautiful, the group's eighth studio album and first with Jansen on board, followed in early 2015., 35901=Nightwish toured Europe heavily, consolidating their success, and in 2000 recorded their third album, Wishmaster. Not only did it top the Finnish charts, but it also became the group's first album to be released in the U.S. (by Century Media, which reissued their previous albums in 2001 as well). Released in 2002, Century Child proved a massive hit in Finland and around Europe, but 2004's Once saw them go one step further and conquer Europe. Number one in Germany and number one in the European Top 100, Once's success was the product of a band at the top of its game following years of hard work. Marco Hietala was now on bass, replacing Sami VÃ¤nskÃ¤, while in 2005 Swedish singer Anette Olzon replaced Tarja Turunen, who was fired for personal reasons. Dark Passion Play (2007) and the concept album Imaginaerum (2011) both featured Olzon before she and the band parted ways in 2012, halfway through the band's world tour., 36787=Following in the footsteps of the Gathering and Lacuna Coil (goth-influenced ""symphonic"" metal bands with female vocalists), Nightwish were formed in Kitee, Finland, in 1997 by keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen. Initially attempting to create acoustic music, he recruited trained opera vocalist Tarja Turunen, but soon added full metal band instrumentation in the persons of guitarist Emppo Vuorinen, bassist Sami VÃ¤nskÃ¤, and drummer Jukka Nevalainen. Nightwish's demos landed them a contract with the Finnish label Spinefarm, which released their debut album, Angels Fall First, in late 1997 (it appeared in the rest of Europe the following year). The follow-up, Oceanborn, appeared in late 1998 and made Nightwish a bona fide mainstream success in their homeland; the album reached the Finnish Top Five and spun off three Top Ten singles.}"

This is similar to reading and writing in standard File I/O classes. For more information about I/O, see the System.IO namespace. The System.IO.IsolatedStorage namespace contains types that allow the creation and use of isolated stores. With these stores, you can read and write data that less trusted code cannot access and prevent the exposure of sensitive information that can be saved elsewhere on the file system. Data is stored in compartments that are isolated by the current user and by the assembly in which the code exists. Additionally, data can be isolated by domain. Roaming profiles can be used in conjunction with isolated storage so isolated stores will travel with the user's profile. The IsolatedStorageScope enumeration indicates different types of isolation.

Sonny John Moore, better known by his stage name Skrillex, is an American electronic music producer, DJ, singer and songwriter. Growing up in Northeast Los Angeles and in Northern California, Sonny Moore joined the American post-hardcore band From First to Last as the lead singer in 2004, and recorded two studio albums with the band before leaving to pursue a solo career in 2007. He began his first tour as a solo artist in late 2007.

To address this sanitation crisis, it is now clear that programs focused on latrine construction will not be enough. New approaches like Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) have proven that communities can be motivated to change their sanitation situation â but that the first step is triggering behaviour change.}"

Sure, the Celtics are 12 games under .500, but that is still in the playoff hunt in the East. So Boston used the trade deadline to actually get better. They traded Marcus Thornton and a 2016 first round pick to the Phoenix Suns for point guard Isaiah Thomas. Thomas is a pretty good point guard and has a reasonable contract - less than $20 million for the next three years., 15962=The massive TD Garden was finished in 1995 for a cost of $160 million. Originally known as the Shawmut Center, the TD Garden is now home to two of the most successful sports teams in North America: the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics. The Celtics last won the NBA Championship in 2008 while the Bruins brought home the Stanley Cup in 2011. The arena is also home to the NLL's Boston Blazers. TD Garden underwent a major overhaul in 2006. New feature included a new, beautiful HD entertainment board and video advertising boards that replaced the original scrolling panels. A vintage siren was also added as a goal horn for hockey games. In the past, the arena has also hosted Northeastern University's commencement, UFC events, Wrestlemania and several other WWF events, and some of the nation's biggest concerts. TD Garden is built on top of Boston's North Station, a major transportation hub, so getting to games and concerts is a breeze., 15494=The Boston Celtics have been a perennial powerhouse in the Eastern Conference since the arrival of Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007. With the help of longtime Celtic Paul Pierce, the 'Big Three' were able to bring a Championship to Boston in 2008. The Eastern Conference is really heating up this season, so make sure you buy Boston Celtics tickets so you don't miss out on the action., 18147=New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics First Round Preview New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics NBA Playoffs Tickets New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics First Round Preview The New York Knicks have not won a playoff series since the 1999-2000 NBA Playoffs - quite some time for one of the major markets and marquee franchisesâ¦, 13416=5/18/12 The Boston Celtics bounced back from their Game 2 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers with a big 107-91 win on the road in Game 3. Kevin Garnett partied like it was 2008 in putting up 27 points, 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Garnett looked to be almost five years younger in dominating the Sixers in the low-post as well as making them pay with his patented mid-range jumper. Back in control now with a 2-1 series lead, the Celtics will look to put themselves firmly in the driver's seat with another win in Game 4 at the Wells Fargo Center on Friday night., 14965=Boston Celtics tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NBA's most storied franchises work to return to the finals after winning it all in 2008. Founded in 1946, the Celtics' record 17 NBA championships are the most of any NBA franchise and just one more than the rival L.A. Lakers. The Celtics play their games at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Watch as the Celts add to their legacy and work to bring another NBA Championship to Boston!, 6067=1/21/15: All the sports teams in Boston are vulnerable to intense media pressure, particularly when they are losing. Perhaps the Celtics have gotten a bit of a break lately because the New England Patriots are rolling through the playoffs, but that does not escape the fact that they have less than 15 wins and it is getting into late January. The ""T"" word (tanking) is being thrown around, but no one knows for sure. In any case the Celtics have made a number of trades recently and then gotten rid of guys they have gotten back. That includes Jameer Nelson, Chris Douglas-Roberts and Brandan Write. Yes, this is frustrating right now, but it should build a better team in the future., 17491=Get ready to catch your favorite Celtics players in action for the 2011-12 NBA season. You'll be glued to the screen watching Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, Paul Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley and the rest of the team. Let's see if they will be able to bring home the trophy again as they did in the 2008 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers., 16984=Boston Celtics tickets ensure that fans see the Celtics playing top contenders throughout the entire NBA season. The Celtics have a solid shot at winning the Atlantic Division in 2011. With matchups against great teams like the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks and non-divisional meetings with Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers, the Celtics are sure to be tested all season long.

Sure, the Celtics are 12 games under .500, but that is still in the playoff hunt in the East. So Boston used the trade deadline to actually get better. They traded Marcus Thornton and a 2016 first round pick to the Phoenix Suns for point guard Isaiah Thomas. Thomas is a pretty good point guard and has a reasonable contract - less than $20 million for the next three years., 15962=The massive TD Garden was finished in 1995 for a cost of $160 million. Originally known as the Shawmut Center, the TD Garden is now home to two of the most successful sports teams in North America: the Boston Bruins and Boston Celtics. The Celtics last won the NBA Championship in 2008 while the Bruins brought home the Stanley Cup in 2011. The arena is also home to the NLL's Boston Blazers. TD Garden underwent a major overhaul in 2006. New feature included a new, beautiful HD entertainment board and video advertising boards that replaced the original scrolling panels. A vintage siren was also added as a goal horn for hockey games. In the past, the arena has also hosted Northeastern University's commencement, UFC events, Wrestlemania and several other WWF events, and some of the nation's biggest concerts. TD Garden is built on top of Boston's North Station, a major transportation hub, so getting to games and concerts is a breeze., 15494=The Boston Celtics have been a perennial powerhouse in the Eastern Conference since the arrival of Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in 2007. With the help of longtime Celtic Paul Pierce, the 'Big Three' were able to bring a Championship to Boston in 2008. The Eastern Conference is really heating up this season, so make sure you buy Boston Celtics tickets so you don't miss out on the action., 18147=New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics First Round Preview New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics NBA Playoffs Tickets New York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics First Round Preview The New York Knicks have not won a playoff series since the 1999-2000 NBA Playoffs - quite some time for one of the major markets and marquee franchisesâ¦, 13416=5/18/12 The Boston Celtics bounced back from their Game 2 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers with a big 107-91 win on the road in Game 3. Kevin Garnett partied like it was 2008 in putting up 27 points, 13 rebounds and 4 assists. Garnett looked to be almost five years younger in dominating the Sixers in the low-post as well as making them pay with his patented mid-range jumper. Back in control now with a 2-1 series lead, the Celtics will look to put themselves firmly in the driver's seat with another win in Game 4 at the Wells Fargo Center on Friday night., 14965=Boston Celtics tickets allow fans the opportunity to see one of the NBA's most storied franchises work to return to the finals after winning it all in 2008. Founded in 1946, the Celtics' record 17 NBA championships are the most of any NBA franchise and just one more than the rival L.A. Lakers. The Celtics play their games at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. Watch as the Celts add to their legacy and work to bring another NBA Championship to Boston!, 6067=1/21/15: All the sports teams in Boston are vulnerable to intense media pressure, particularly when they are losing. Perhaps the Celtics have gotten a bit of a break lately because the New England Patriots are rolling through the playoffs, but that does not escape the fact that they have less than 15 wins and it is getting into late January. The ""T"" word (tanking) is being thrown around, but no one knows for sure. In any case the Celtics have made a number of trades recently and then gotten rid of guys they have gotten back. That includes Jameer Nelson, Chris Douglas-Roberts and Brandan Write. Yes, this is frustrating right now, but it should build a better team in the future., 17491=Get ready to catch your favorite Celtics players in action for the 2011-12 NBA season. You'll be glued to the screen watching Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo, Paul Pierce, Jermaine O'Neal, Jeff Green, Avery Bradley and the rest of the team. Let's see if they will be able to bring home the trophy again as they did in the 2008 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers., 16984=Boston Celtics tickets ensure that fans see the Celtics playing top contenders throughout the entire NBA season. The Celtics have a solid shot at winning the Atlantic Division in 2011. With matchups against great teams like the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks and non-divisional meetings with Kobe Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers, the Celtics are sure to be tested all season long.

Si les 2 segments avec les types les plus hauts sont du mÃªme type, utilisez ce type pour le rond-point. SÃ©lectionnez tous les segments qui composent le rond-point et dÃ©finissez leur type de route en respectant les 2 rÃ¨gles ci-dessous: ces deux segments (avec les types les plus hauts) peuvent Ãªtre du mÃªme type ou non.

[3] We also calculated an all-others rate. In accordance with sections 703(d) and 705(c)(5)(A) of the Act, for companies not individually investigated, we apply an âall-othersâ? rate, which is normally calculated by weighting the subsidy rates of the individual companies selected as mandatory respondents by those companies' exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. Under section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act, the all-others rate should exclude zero and de minimis rates calculated for the exporters and producers individually investigated as well as rates based entirely on facts otherwise available. Where the rates for the investigated companies are all zero or de minimis, or based entirely on facts otherwise available, section 705(c)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act instructs the Department to establish an all-others rate using âany reasonable method.â? Notwithstanding the language of section 705(c)(5)(A)(i) of the Act, we have not calculated the âall-othersâ? rate by weight averaging the rates of the two individually investigated respondents, because doing so risks disclosure of proprietary information. Therefore, and consistent with the Department's practice where such risk exists, for the âall-othersâ? rate, we calculated a simple average of the two responding firms' rates.

An average smoke alarm is required to sound at 85 decibels from a distance of 3 metresÂ - it will be much louder at close range. Volume Background Fire can strike at anyoneâs home, but not everyone is equally protected because people who are deaf or hard of hearing canât rely on hearing an ordinary alarm. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, there a wide range of smoke alarms available specifically designed for you. Emma Harrison, RNID Director of Public Engagement said: The high pitched beep-beep-beep of a smoke alarm can be irritating when set off by accident. But what makes that sound annoying - the pitch, volume and pattern of the alarm - all trigger powerful instinctive threat responses in your brain and warn you of danger. If youâre in a real fire, this irritating sound could save your life, so trust your instincts and check your smoke alarm regularly. Prof. Trevor Cox, President of the Institute of Acoustics said: Never, ever remove the batteries in your alarm. It may be frustrating to find your fry-up has set it off again, but a working smoke alarm could mean the difference between life and death in a real house fire. A matter of life and death Itâs a familiar situation - burning","Pitch Added to this, most smoke alarms sound at a frequency of around 3,000 Hz, the uppermost range of a piccolo or violin.
