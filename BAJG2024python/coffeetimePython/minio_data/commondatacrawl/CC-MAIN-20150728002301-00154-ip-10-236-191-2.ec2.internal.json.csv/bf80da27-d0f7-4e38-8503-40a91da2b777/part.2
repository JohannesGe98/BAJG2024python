She set out to establish a winning tradition at Nebraska after she was hired on June 24, 2002., 40831=Nebraska's rise to the upper echelon in the Big 12 continued in 2006-07.

NU earned a first-round bye in the Big 12 Tournament by finishing in a tie for fourth in the league standings., 39874=The Huskers closed the season as one of the Big 12's hottest teams, winning seven of their last 10 games including a trip to the WNIT quarterfinals, despite a late-season illness to freshman phenom Kelsey Griffin. NU's strong finish came while establishing a measure of dominance against Big 12 North competition. Nebraska went 5-0 in rematches with North Division opponents in 2005-06, and finished the year with a 7-3 mark against North schools, before adding a victory against Colorado in the first round of the Big 12 Tournament., 44492=Nebraska's eighth recruiting class lived up to the lofty expectations created by the success of the Huskers' 2010 senior class.

Nebraska improved 17 games in the win column after advancing to the postseason in 2008-09., 39272=Hardy's rise along with the addition of 2005 Big 12 Newcomer of the Year Jelena Spiric and the leadership of Chelsea Aubry gave NU high hopes for 2005-06. Those hopes were tempered the first week of fall practice by the loss of Spiric to a season-ending knee injury., 28641=In addition to Nebraska's incredible rise to prominence on the national scene in 2009-10, the Huskers became a marquee attraction across the Midwest. Nebraska led the Big 12 by averaging 11,383 fans over eight league home games, while shattering the school attendance records. NU ranked No. 7 nationally with 7,390 fans per game, while drawing seven consecutive crowds of more than 10,000 to close the season. That record streak included the school's first capacity crowd of 13,595 at the Devaney Center for a win over Missouri on Feb. 27, which included a Big 12 regular-season title presentation and the cutting down of the nets at the Devaney Center for the first time since 1988., 50043=A 1982 graduate of Ankeny High School, Yori is a two-time inductee into the Iowa Girl's High School Athletic Union Hall of Fame as a basketball and softball player. She led the Hawkettes to a state title in 1980 and a runner-up finish in 1981, scoring 3,068 points in her six-on-six prep career. A four-time first-team all-state shortstop, Yori also helped Ankeny to state softball titles in 1979, 1980 and 1981., 32707=In 2007-08, Yori guided Nebraska to one of its best seasons, as the Huskers claimed their third NCAA Tournament victory in history with a 61-58 win over Xavier in College Park, Md., 47152=The Ankeny, Iowa, native produced a 170-115 (.596) mark in 10 seasons at Creighton. Overall, Yori spent 17 seasons at Creighton, including four as a guard (1982-83 through 1985-86) and three as an assistant coach (1986-87 through 1988-89) under Bruce Rasmussen., 37442=Although NU had to replace four senior starters in 2003-04, the 2004-05 squad continued the program's climb., 42455=Nebraska's rise has followed continued recruiting success. Yori's first group of recruits included Hardy and Aubry. Yori's second group included Danielle Page, who spent the 2008 WNBA season with the Connecticut Sun. Page is set to enter her eighth professional season overseas in 2015-16, while also competing with the Serbian National Team for the first time in 2015., 42058=Aubry, a captain and member of the Canadian Senior National Team who eventually became Nebraska's first Olympian in 2012, added honorable-mention All-Big 12 recognition as a senior. She also earned academic All-Big 12 honors and served on Nebraska's Student-Athlete Advisory Committee with Griffin., 81748=2006-07, 86738=2009-10, 17254=The 6-4 Shepard, who committed to Nebraska before her freshman year at Lincoln Southeast High School in 2011-12, is joined in NU's 2015-16 freshman class by 2015 Nebraska Gatorade Player of the Year Maddie Simon from Lincoln Pius X.

A starter on the USA Basketball U18 National Team at the FIBA Americas Championship in the summer of 2014, Shepard ranked among the most productive scorers and rebounders in Nebraska prep history, despite missing more than half of her senior season at Fremont High School with a knee injury., 32448=In Griffin's absence, Montgomery and Turner emerged as rising stars in the Big 12, setting up Nebraska's storybook season in 2009-10 with the return of Griffin., 31362=In 2008-09, Nebraska battled its way to a Postseason WNIT bid despite losing Griffin to an ankle injury before the season began. The Huskers were dealt a further blow inside with the loss of center Nikki Bober, just days after helping the Huskers to a win over No. 24 Arizona State at the Devaney Center on Dec. 28. The Sun Devils went on to advance to the 2009 NCAA Elite Eight., 31840=The Huskers, who finished the year with a 15-16 overall record and a 6-10 Big 12 mark, tied for seventh in the nation's strongest conference.

The award was presented to the team that showed the greatest overall commitment to Nebraska's community outreach program, an impressive accomplishment considering Nebraska's overall Life Skills program has been named the best in the nation., 32986=Along with leading Nebraska to its first NCAA Tournament win in a decade, Yori helped the Huskers to their first back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances since the 1999 and 2000 seasons, while posting back-to-back 20-win campaigns for the first time since 1998 and 1999., 28127=Griffin has continued her WNBA career with the Sun into the 2015 season, while also spending professional seasons in Hungary, Israel and most recently, three extremely successful seasons in Australia.

Nebraska's strength of schedule ranked No. 24 nationally heading into postseason play., 33355=In 2007-08, Yori's Huskers finished with a 21-12 record despite a 13-player roster that featured five true freshmen, five sophomores and one junior college transfer. Griffin, an All-Big 12 forward, was the only Husker to ever start a game in an NU uniform heading into the 2007-08 campaign., 38433=Nebraska finished 2004-05 with an 18-14 record despite playing 11 games against top 25 foes. Along with the win over No. 2 Baylor, NU defeated No. 14 Iowa State 88-59 on Feb. 12 in Lincoln, to give NU its largest victory margin in history over a top-25 opponent. Yori's 2004-05 squad was composed of seven newcomers on a 12-player roster. The newcomers were led by senior point guard Jina Johansen and were sparked by the emergence of Kiera Hardy, who became the third sophomore in school history to earn first-team all-conference honors. She was just the third Husker since the inception of the Big 12 in 1996-97 to claim first-team All-Big 12 accolades., 43543=NU's fifth group included 2007 Miss Nebraska Basketball Dominique Kelley, who set a Husker record by starting all 33 games as a freshman in 2007-08, Canadian National Program member Kaitlyn Burke, California State Junior College Tournament MVP Tay Hester, French National Team member Jessica Periago, and Texas all-stater Catheryn Redmon., 74869=2002-03, 9792=Despite the challenges, Nebraska extended its school-record streak of 43 consecutive weeks in the USA Today/Coaches Top 25, before slipping from the poll on March 2, 2015.

The win came in front of a national television audience on Fox Sports Net and marked the highest-ranked team the Huskers had ever defeated at the Devaney Center. NU added a 7-9 Big 12 mark and may have finished just one win shy of the school's first NCAA Tournament bid since 2000. NU finished in a three-way tie for seventh in a league that sent nine teams to the postseason, including the Huskers., 11755=Nebraska also finished No. 19 in the NCAA RPI, before claiming a No. 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament - its second-highest seed in school history, trailing only the No. 1 seed the Huskers captured in 2010., 12840=A finalist for the Wade Trophy, Naismith Trophy and Senior CLASS Award, Hooper set Nebraska's school record with 295 threes, while finishing second in school history in points (2,357) and No. 3 in rebounds (1,110).

NU's tournament run came to an end in a 53-45 loss to No. 2 seed Duke at Old Dominion., 20804=In 2012-13, Yori led Nebraska to the program's second trip to the NCAA Sweet 16 in the past four years. A roster that featured just two seniors rolled to the third-most wins in school history (25), while notching the second-highest conference victory total (12) in the Husker record books. From mid-January through February, Yori's Huskers reeled off 10 consecutive Big Ten wins on their way to a conference regular-season runner-up finish (12-4)., 8720=In 2014-15, the Huskers overcame a barrage of injuries, including a season-ending injury to All-America point guard Rachel Theriot in early February, to advance to the NCAA Tournament and finish with a 21-11 overall record.

In the first 35 seasons of Nebraska women's basketball, Huskers had claimed only eight All-America awards., 30848=Even before its breakthrough 2009-10 campaign, the Huskers had earned six consecutive postseason tournament appearances, including back-to-back trips to the NCAA Tournament in 2007 and 2008.

Next week we will do the pitchers. For the full stats, go ahead andÃ‚Â click here. Stats are updated through Friday, August 22. One more thing, all ""+"" stats are averaged at 100. Anything over 100, like 110, is higher and means that player is 10 percent better than the league average. Anything under 100, like 90, is lower and means that player is 10 percent worse than the league average. In the case of any ""-"" stats -- when lower is better, like with ERA -- a 90 ERA- means that player is 10 percent better than the league average. Also note that pitchers have FIP-based WAR -- which is based on peripherals like strikeouts, walks, home runs, etc. -- and RA-based WAR -- which is based on runs allowed. As a reminder, a 0.0 WAR per 162 games is replacement level -- otherwise known as the kind of performance an average player from the level below could offer -- a 2.0 WAR per 162 games is average, and a 5.0 WAR per 162 games is All-Star level.

Those marks fell from 2.2 and 4.4 respectivelyÃ‚Â since July 27, a falloff that could be the result of his shoulder injury. Colon went on the disabled list on Friday with a right shoulder strain, a scary injury for a pitcher who had issues staying healthy in the past. As it stands now, Colon's 138.0 innings mark a new career high (topping his 126.0 in 2012), but even if his performance drop over the past month is all injury-related, Colon does not seem to be a safe bet to make it through a full season., 61913=The WAR RoomÃ‚Â is back again, bringing you the 2014 advanced stats for every Cleveland minor leaguer.

For the full stats, go ahead andÃ‚Â click here. Stats are updated through Friday, August 22., 114402=Right-handerÃ‚Â Dylan Baker's season started so well with six perfect innings, but after breaking his ankle before his second start and working his way back, the 22-year-old struggled a bit. Though the struggles are natural given the nature of his injury and the time off it required, 0.3 FIP-based WAR and 0.1 RA-based WAR in 32.2 inningsÃ‚Â is still pretty low. The most important thing for Baker is he is pitching again and getting some experience in 2014, but unfortunately his freak injury derailed a terrific start to the season and essentially turned it into a lost year., 132102=Stats and performance can tell us more definitive things about Triple-A players than ones in Low-A, something that gives hope for right-handerÃ‚Â Caleb Hamrick'sÃ‚Â future. Hamrick's -1.1 FIP-based WAR and -2.9 RA-based WAR in 90.0 innings is certainly unsightly, but it is still all about projection for the right-hander. As an eighth round pick in 2012 who found success in Mahoning Valley last year (3.20 ERA, 4.39 FIP in 76.0 innings), Hamrick is likely to get more chances going forward. It would be nicer if Hamrick did not own a 7.10 ERA (188 ERA-), a 5.12 FIP (135 FIP-), a 12.7 percent strikeout rate (61 K%+), and a 11.8 percent walk rate (141 BB%+), but those stats are not the only thing the right-hander will be judged on., 190564=The 2014 Cleveland Indians Baseball Insider book featuring the Indians' Top 100 Prospects and more is now available.

Thanks again for all the support!, 129798=Life has been good recently for right-handerÃ‚Â Mitch Brown, as the second round pick in the 2012 draft has taken a big step forward in his second full professional season. Though an above-average 2.0 FIP-based WAR and 2.5 RA-based WAR in 132.2 innings is not groundbreaking, seeing Brown get results after last season's struggles is great. There are still things for Brown to work on, as his results are helped by a 0.34 HR/9 (57 HR/9+) and his 10.0 percent walk rate (119 BB%+) is still high, but it is a step in the right direction for Brown. The right-hander is still only 20 years old, is on the upswing, and should get a shot to continue this success in Carolina next year., 100308=After reaching Double-A in his first full professional season in 2012, right-handerÃ‚Â Shawn ArmstrongÃ‚Â got stuck there over the course of three seasons. Armstrong finally got his promotion to Columbus recently due to a stellar 2014 season with the RubberDucks. With 1.0 FIP-based WAR and 1.6 RA-based WAR in 51.0 innings, Armstrong finally put together his talent and lived up to his promise. Armstrong is a power pitcher who walks a few more than average (9.2 percent walk rate, 112 BB%+) but more than makes up for it with a 32.9 percent strikeout rate (173 K%+). We will see how quickly that translates up to Triple-A, but as of right now, there is no reason to think Armstrong will not continue dominating hitters in the International League.}",,

Thanks again for all the support!, 129798=Life has been good recently for right-handerÃ‚Â Mitch Brown, as the second round pick in the 2012 draft has taken a big step forward in his second full professional season. Though an above-average 2.0 FIP-based WAR and 2.5 RA-based WAR in 132.2 innings is not groundbreaking, seeing Brown get results after last season's struggles is great. There are still things for Brown to work on, as his results are helped by a 0.34 HR/9 (57 HR/9+) and his 10.0 percent walk rate (119 BB%+) is still high, but it is a step in the right direction for Brown. The right-hander is still only 20 years old, is on the upswing, and should get a shot to continue this success in Carolina next year., 100308=After reaching Double-A in his first full professional season in 2012, right-handerÃ‚Â Shawn ArmstrongÃ‚Â got stuck there over the course of three seasons. Armstrong finally got his promotion to Columbus recently due to a stellar 2014 season with the RubberDucks. With 1.0 FIP-based WAR and 1.6 RA-based WAR in 51.0 innings, Armstrong finally put together his talent and lived up to his promise. Armstrong is a power pitcher who walks a few more than average (9.2 percent walk rate, 112 BB%+) but more than makes up for it with a 32.9 percent strikeout rate (173 K%+). We will see how quickly that translates up to Triple-A, but as of right now, there is no reason to think Armstrong will not continue dominating hitters in the International League.}",,

With the CVA results being subject to the Football League`s own investigation, the club are currently unable to enter the transfer market, meaning Wise currently has to sit patiently. Whilst Wise, assistant boss Gus Poyet and ""new"" owner Ken Bates have started discussions with players, no firm moves in or indeed out of Elland Road can be made until the start of July. Wise told the official Leeds United website: 'There's no harm in talking to people, but we'll just have to wait,' He added: 'There's a lot of players we earmarked who've gone, about 10 of them, but we understand the situation so we're not going to harp on about it. We're here to do a job."" The start of pre-season training is just 10 days away now, so any potential new signings will have to learn very quickly and adapt to life at the club. Let`s just hope that when the Ok comes down from the Football League, that the management, backroom and most importantly boardroom staff are ready to rise to the challenge of bringing quality to the club within an ever shortening timescale.

I always thought you have to cook the ketchup but he just mixed everything in his ingenious recipe and that was it! I liked the result. I didnÃ¢Â€Â™t use Splenda Ã¢Â€Â” which the recipe used Ã¢Â€Â” but powdered erythritol instead. That gave a bit of cool aftertaste which was somewhat prominent but very tolerable after all. Somehow the tomato paste was overpowering tastewise. Actually, it also felt a little flaky and frictional on my tongue. Yes, I think those weird words describe the feeling best. The recipe as such was simple and great, but it just wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t perfect to my personal taste. So, I needed to create something which would go better with my personal taste. I started tweaking the recipe. After some heavy tweaking there wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t much left from the original recipe, just tomato sauce and tomato paste, and the quantities and ratios were completely different from those of the original recipe. In my experiments I drastically reduced the amount of tomato paste to get rid of that weird taste and feeling it gave. I noticed that you need just a small amount of tomato paste to reach the ideal consistency and the right taste. I also tested different spices. I thought white pepper would have been an ideal spice",True,0,0,"{9414=Posted on February 18, 2014.

Because of the very large range of the solid solution, the composition actually achieved is specific to a factory and, therefore, a good production marker [ 61 , 60 , 59 wares, Naples yellow, a large pyrochlore solid solution between PbO-SnO2-Sb2O3/Sb2O5 with addition of SiO2, Fe2O3, and ZnO became the most widely used pigment [ majolica ].

Yellow ]. 199 , 187 , 165 , 77 , 76 ]: the selected kaolin has iron oxide traces and the fired body remains gray, not white. The opacification of the glaze was only achieved by dispersion of micronic bubbles, a technique not sufficient to completely cover the gray color of the body. To achieve a white color, BÃƒÂ¶ttger, educated as lapidarian expert, added lapis lazuli blue grains at the body-glaze interface: the artifact looked as white as the Chinese model, made with Kaolin of higher quality. Different modern ceramic","New pigments were searched for during the 19th and 20th centuries ( Table 3 ) to obtain a variety of yellow hues, such as uranium yellow, zinc-chrome yellow, rutile yellow, Praseodymium yellow, etc. [ 76 , 77 , 165 , 199 ]. A specific mention must be made of silver yellow: yellow glasses are prepared by diffusion of Ag+ silver ion from the glass surface inward and then in situ reduction into metal nanoparticles to obtain coloration by the AgÃ‚Â° plasmon light absorption. This technique was first described in middle-age reports [ 22 , 79 , 106 ]. Because the plasmon absorption is very strong, the layer colored by silver metal particles must be very thin to keep its transparency (see further the discussion for red copper glass). Note that the huge plasmon absorption peak makes the observation of low wavenumber nanoparticle modes difficult under excitation with absorbed laser wavelength [ 79 ]. In this case, the Raman spectrum only reflects the nanostructure around the metal nanoparticle and does not correspond to the glass matrix [ 57 , 79 , 106 , 108 , 201 ]. 6.4.

We have never been what we seemed. When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the ""ungettable"" Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability: Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed. But after Scott sells his first novel, This Side of Paradise, to Scribner's, Zelda optimistically boards a train north, to marry him in the vestry of St. Patrick's Cathedral and take the rest as it comes. What comes, here at the dawn of the Jazz Age, is unimagined attention and success and celebrity that will make Scott and Zelda legends in their own time. Everyone wants to meet the dashing young author of the scandalous novel--and his witty, perhaps even more scandalous wife. Zelda bobs her hair, adopts daring new fashions, and revels in this wild new world. Each place they go becomes a playground: New York City, Long Island, Hollywood, Paris, and the French Riviera--where they join the endless party of the glamorous, sometimes doomed Lost Generation that includes Ernest Hemingway, Sara and Gerald Murphy, and Gertrude Stein. Everything seems new and possible. Troubles, at first, seem to fade like morning mist. But not even Jay Gatsby's parties go on forever. Who is Zelda, other than the wife of a famous--sometimes infamous--husband? How can she forge her own identity while fighting her demons and Scott's, too? With brilliant insight and imagination, Therese Anne Fowler brings us Zelda's irresistible story as she herself might have told it.}","Tue, 28 Jul 2015 01:27:42 GMT"

Kobe calls ESPN a bunch of idiots for raking him 40th best current player in the league. With Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, Rondo, and DWade right above him. I think it's a pretty good representation of where his game is at right now, given his age and coming back from injury. Not sure what the big deal is. Just win on the court and let the talking heads do the talking. The East looks like it's the Cavs to lose at this point. I don't think the Bulls w/ Noah and a healthy DRose can beat them. Miami is not close any more. And not sure which Pacers team is showing up this year, the one from early last season, or the one that fell apart at the end. The West will be much more competitive with Spurs, OKC, Clippers, Rockets, and Mavs. I think Rockets got worse after losing Chandler Parsons. OKC will miss KD for a bit. Clippers look good. And the revamped Mavs should be competitive as well. The West will be fun to watch.",False,-1,0,,,

An unknown figure approaches while Emily tearfully whispers, Ã¢Â€ÂœIÃ¢Â€Â™m sorry.Ã¢Â€?

It motivates and paralyzes the best of us... or is used as a weapon by the worst. But when your path is one of treachery and deception... the greatest fear of all... is that the truth is absolute. Closing Narration Emily: Fear is the most primal of emotions. It can linger as a memory burned into one's mind of a parent taken too soon. Or burrow into one's soul as self-doubt over a child's rejection. But the one thing we all fear the most... is the unknown.

The antiviral activity can involve one or several isoform(s) and can be enhanced by the permanent PML-NB-associated protein DAXX or by the recruitment of p53/TP53 within these structures. Isoform PML-4 restricts varicella zoster virus (VZV) via sequestration of virion capsids in PML-NBs thereby preventing their nuclear egress and inhibiting formation of infectious virus particles. The sumoylated isoform PML-4 restricts rabies virus by inhibiting viral mRNA and protein synthesis. The cytoplasmic isoform PML-14 can restrict herpes simplex virus-1 (HHV-1) replication by sequestering the viral E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ICP0 in the cytoplasm. Isoform PML-6 shows restriction activity towards human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and influenza A virus strains PR8(H1N1) and ST364(H3N2). Sumoylated isoform PML-4 and isoform PML-12 show antiviral activity against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) by promoting nuclear sequestration of viral polymerase (P3D-POL) within PML NBs. Isoform PML-3 exhibits antiviral activity against poliovirus by inducing apoptosis in infected cells through the recruitment and the activation of p53/TP53 in the PML-NBs. Isoform PML-3 represses human foamy virus (HFV) transcription by complexing the HFV transactivator, bel1/tas, preventing its binding to viral DNA.

DespuÃƒÂ©s de comenzar a hacerse las pruebas, estas deberÃƒÂ­an realizarse todos los aÃƒÂ±os.1 Una prueba de albÃƒÂºmina en la orina puede detectar cantidades muy pequeÃƒÂ±as de proteÃƒÂ­na en la orina que no pueden detectarse con un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de orina de rutina, lo que permite la detecciÃƒÂ³n temprana de la nefropatÃƒÂ­a. La detecciÃƒÂ³n temprana es importante para prevenir un mayor daÃƒÂ±o en los riÃƒÂ±ones. Se necesitan los resultados de dos anÃƒÂ¡lisis, hechos en un perÃƒÂ­odo de 3 a 6 meses, para diagnosticar la nefropatÃƒÂ­a. La nefropatÃƒÂ­a diabÃƒÂ©tica se diagnostica mediante pruebas que detectan una proteÃƒÂ­na (albÃƒÂºmina) en la orina, que indica daÃƒÂ±o renal. Se le revisarÃƒÂ¡ la orina para detectar proteÃƒÂ­nas (anÃƒÂ¡lisis de orina) cuando se le diagnostique diabetes. ExÃƒÂ¡menes y pruebas Si los riÃƒÂ±ones estÃƒÂ¡n gravemente daÃƒÂ±ados, los niveles de azÃƒÂºcar en la sangre pueden disminuir debido a que los riÃƒÂ±ones no pueden eliminar el exceso de insulina ni filtrar los medicamentos orales que aumentan la producciÃƒÂ³n de insulina. Problemas para dormir. NÃƒÂ¡useas o vÃƒÂ³mito. SensaciÃƒÂ³n de cansancio o agotamiento. Debilidad. PÃƒÂ©rdida de peso. Poco apetito. HinchazÃƒÂ³n (edema), primero en los pies y en las piernas, y despuÃƒÂ©s en todo el cuerpo. Usted podrÃƒÂ­a tener sÃƒÂ­ntomas si su nefropatÃƒÂ­a empeora. Entre estos sÃƒÂ­ntomas se incluyen: Tener niveles","Una prueba con un dispositivo reactivo a la albuminuria es una prueba simple que puede detectar pequeÃƒÂ±as cantidades de proteÃƒÂ­na en la orina. La tira cambia de color si hay proteÃƒÂ­na presente y brinda un cÃƒÂ¡lculo aproximado de la cantidad de proteÃƒÂ­na. El anÃƒÂ¡lisis de orina rÃƒÂ¡pido para detectar la albuminuria es un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de laboratorio mÃƒÂ¡s preciso que puede medir la cantidad exacta de proteÃƒÂ­na en una muestra de orina. Cada una de estas pruebas podrÃƒÂ­a ser utilizada para analizar la proteÃƒÂ­na presente en la orina. TambiÃƒÂ©n se le realizarÃƒÂ¡ una prueba de creatinina todos los aÃƒÂ±os. El anÃƒÂ¡lisis de creatinina es un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de sangre que muestra cuÃƒÂ¡n bien estÃƒÂ¡n funcionando los riÃƒÂ±ones. Si su mÃƒÂ©dico sospecha que la proteÃƒÂ­na en la orina podrÃƒÂ­a ser causada por una enfermedad diferente de la diabetes, se pueden realizar otros anÃƒÂ¡lisis de sangre y de orina. Es posible que se le extraiga y examine una pequeÃƒÂ±a muestra de tejido de riÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n (biopsia de riÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n). Otras pruebas Es importante que controle su presiÃƒÂ³n arterial en forma regular, tanto en el hogar como en el consultorio de su mÃƒÂ©dico, debido a que la presiÃƒÂ³n arterial aumenta a medida que avanza el daÃƒÂ±o en los riÃƒÂ±ones. Para la mayorÃƒÂ­a de las personas que tienen diabetes, la presiÃƒÂ³n arterial ideal es por debajo de 120/80. La presiÃƒÂ³n arterial alta es 140/80 o mÃƒÂ¡s cuando usted tiene diabetes.

Also, users can flag quotes for Zillow's QA team to investigate and review their experiences with lenders. Accuracy Promise Zillow confirms through the NMLS that lenders are licensed to originate mortgage business in the state(s) they are quoting in before they are allowed to participate in the marketplace. Confirmed Lender Annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of credit expressed as a yearly rate. The APR includes the interest rate, points, lender fees, and certain other financing charges the borrower is required to pay. Using APR to compare quotes is helpful because it takes into account both the interest rate and financing fees. The APR is calculated by Zillow. The interest rate is the yearly rate charged by a lender to a borrower in order for the borrower to obtain a loan. This is usually expressed as a percentage of the total amount loaned.

REFERENCES The SMP management grant currently supports one project scientist, Dr. Joanie Kleypas, who works at NCAR on coordinating the SMP infrastructure:Ã‚Â  meetings and workshops, journal special issues, the SMP web-page, and the developing data management systems.Ã‚Â  Two main options are open to accommodate the growing demands of the data management effort and more science-directed community projects: expand the scope and resources of the SMP management group and Woods Hole Data Management Office; encourage targeted",Return to Top,True,0,-1,"{21162=A SMP summer workshop series was initiated during the spin-up phase of the project to explore specific scientific themes.Ã‚Â  The two open workshops on Ocean Biogeochemical Time-series (1997) (Doney and Sarmiento, 1998) and Ocean Biogeochemical Response to Climate Change (1998) (Doney, 1998; Doney et al., 1999 ; http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/mzweb/smp/mtgover.htm and http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/mzweb/smp/smp98.htm) successfully engaged a wide community of scientists in discussions on current key issues and future directions for field., 10311=Working groups are a key element in the SMP strategy to promote collaboration and the overall synthesis of JGOFS results.Ã‚Â  The working groups were formed at the 1998 PI meeting in Boulder, CO, and the 1999 PI meeting agenda at Keystone was centered around breakout sessions for the working groups.Ã‚Â  The working group structure is designed to tackle a number of critical tasks of general benefit to the scientific community, but which are larger in scope and/or require more resources than would be typical for a single SMP grant., 4780=The SMP became a full fledged program with the funding of the first SMP awards in early 1998, and at present, the SMP consists of 41 separate grants and 91 investigators.Ã‚Â  Funding for these grants is from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and Department of Energy (DOE) (Table 1)., 21974=The 1999 summer workshop was transformed into an annual SMP PI meeting to accommodate the growing size of the project. The main goals of the meeting held this past July at Keystone, Colorado were to:, 29898=Along more traditional lines, a SMP journal special issue in Deep-Sea Research II has been announced with a submission deadline of April, 2000 (guest editors S. Doney and J. Sarmiento).Ã‚Â  Another special issue is slated to follow one to one and a half years later.Ã‚Â  The SMP would also benefit from an overview article describing the achievements of U.S. JGOFS in redefining our understanding and quantification of the ocean carbon cycle; such an article in a high profile journal (e.g. Science or Nature) would reach beyond the typical JGOFS community targeted by the DSR special issue series.Ã‚Â  The Community Modeling and Synthesis working group is assisting with many of these issues., 8556=The U.S. JGOFS SMP is expected to continue through the 2003-2004 time frame, and a third round of proposals submitted for funding beginning in FY 2000 is currently under review.Ã‚Â  As the program matures and specific initial projects are completed, the foci for the program will be refined to emphasize both emerging new scientific directions and remaining unfinished elements of the original implementation plan.Ã‚Â  The SMP together with the U.S. JGOFS Steering Committee recently assessed the program with the question of future priorities in mind.Ã‚Â  The following topics, of equal importance, were identified as filling critical gaps for SMP science:, 23050=The SMP also hosts a series of topical mini-workshops which focus on specific scientific questions relevant to the overall SMP goals. The mini-workshop format allows in-depth examination of critical problems by experts from both inside the SMP and from the broader community. These meetings have defined goals: to address the key questions and to formulate solution strategies using a combination of data synthesis and modeling.Ã‚Â  In some cases new targeted field studies are identified. Although field studies will not be part of the SMP, this guidance provides the strongÃ‚Â  framework for future observational needs, and will be an important legacy of the program. A particular emphasis of many of these mini-workshops is to develop improved, mechanism based algorithms for incorporating biogeochemical processes into numerical models. The first mini-workshop on Functional Groups was held held in January, 1999 (http://usjgofs.whoi.edu/mzweb/falko_rpt.html), and two more on N2 Fixation and Equatorial Pacific Modeling were recently held in the Fall of 1999.}",,"Wed, 01 Dec 1999 13:13:00 GMT"

La constelÃ‚Â·laciÃƒÂ³ ÃƒÂ©s gran, i es troba just al sud de l'equador celeste. Altres estrelles visibles sÃƒÂ³n la variable Mira i unes altres que malgrat trobar-se en la mateixa direcciÃƒÂ³ des de la Terra, no estan fÃƒÂ­sicament properes unes de les altres: per exemple la gegant taronja Beta Ceti, la mÃƒÂ©s brillant de la constelÃ‚Â·laciÃƒÂ³, estÃƒÂ  aproximadament a 100 anys llum del sol, gairebÃƒÂ© 10 vegades mÃƒÂ©s lluny que Tau Ceti.

Comparant l'espectre es pot estimar els models informÃƒÂ tics de l'evoluciÃƒÂ³ estelÃ‚Â·lar, l'edat, massa, radi i lluminositat de Tau Ceti. Malgrat aixÃƒÂ², utilitzant un interferÃƒÂ²metre astronÃƒÂ²mic, es poden realitzar directament mesuraments del radi de l'estrella amb una presiciÃƒÂ³ del 0,5%.[2] Es desplega una lÃƒÂ­nia de referÃƒÂ¨ncia per mesurar angles molt mÃƒÂ©s petits del que es poden resoldre utilitzant un telescopi convencional. AixÃƒÂ² va resultar, que el radi de Tau Ceti va ser mesurat com el 79.3 Ã‚Â± 0.4% del radi solar.[2] Aquest valor ÃƒÂ©s de la mida estimada per a una estrella amb poc menys de la massa del sol.[25], 35875=La composiciÃƒÂ³ quÃƒÂ­mica d'una estrella proveeix pistes importants de la seva histÃƒÂ²ria evolutiva, incloent-hi l'ÃƒÂ¨poca quan es va formar. El medi interestelÃ‚Â·lar de pols i gas on les estrelles es formen estÃƒÂ  compost bÃƒÂ sicament d'hidrogen i heli amb certes quantitats d'elements pesants. Com que les estrelles properes evolucionen contÃƒÂ­nuament i moren, van plantar en el medi interestelÃ‚Â·lar un augment en la porciÃƒÂ³ d'elements mÃƒÂ©s pesants. AixÃƒÂ­ que les estrelles mÃƒÂ©s joves tendiran a tenir una porciÃƒÂ³ d'elements mÃƒÂ©s pesants mÃƒÂ©s elevada en les seves atmosferes que les estrelles mÃƒÂ©s antigues. Aquests elements pesats sÃƒÂ³n anomenats metalls pels astrÃƒÂ²noms i la porciÃƒÂ³ d'elements pesats ÃƒÂ©s la metalÃ‚Â·licitat.[29] La quantitat de metalÃ‚Â·licitat en una estrella ÃƒÂ©s donada en termes del rÃƒÂ tio de ferro (Fe), i un element pesat de fÃƒÂ cil observaciÃƒÂ³ com l'hidrogen.

Hall i Lockwood van informar que ""els termes 'estrella solar,' 'anÃƒÂ leg solar,' i 'bessona solar' [sÃƒÂ³n] descripcions progressivament restrictives.""[38] Tau Ceti cau en la segona categoria, donant la seva massa i variabilitat semblant, perÃƒÂ² la falta relativa de metalls.[Nota 9] Les semblances han inspirat les referÃƒÂ¨ncies de la cultura popular durant dÃƒÂ¨cades, com tambÃƒÂ© l'examinaciÃƒÂ³ cientÃƒÂ­fica., 20144=El nom ""Tau Ceti"" ÃƒÂ©s la nomenclatura de Bayer d'aquesta estrella, establerta en el 1603 com a part del catÃƒÂ leg estelÃ‚Â·lar Uranometria del cartÃƒÂ²graf celestial alemany Johann Bayer: ÃƒÂ©s el ""nombre T"" en la seqÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¨ncia de Bayer de la constelÃ‚Â·laciÃƒÂ³ Cetus. TÃƒÂ© el nom propi de Durre Menthor,[15] que ve de l'arÃƒÂ b Al Durr' Al-ManthÃ…Â«ur (Ã˜Â§Ã™Â„Ã˜Â¯Ã˜Â±Ã˜Â± Ã˜Â§Ã™Â„Ã™Â…Ã™Â†Ã˜Â«Ã™ÂˆÃ˜Â±), que significar Les Perles Disperses (del Collaret Trencat).[10] En el catÃƒÂ leg d'estrella Calendarium d'Al Achsasi al Mouakket, escrit al Caire al voltant del 1650, aquesta estrella va ser designada com a ThÃ„?lith al NaÃŠÂ½Ã„?mÃ„?t (Ã˜ÂªÃ˜Â§Ã™Â„Ã˜Âª Ã˜Â£Ã™Â„Ã™Â†Ã˜Â¹Ã˜Â§Ã™Â…Ã˜Â© - taalit al naÃŠÂ½Ã„?mÃ„?t), que va ser traduÃƒÂ¯t al llatÃƒÂ­ com a Tertia Struthionum, que significa el tercer dels estruÃƒÂ§os.[16] Aquesta estrella, juntament amb ÃŽÂ· Cet (Deneb Algenubi), ÃŽÂ¸ Cet (Thanih Al Naamat), ÃŽÂ¶ Cet (Baten Kaitos), i ÃÂ… Cet, foren els Al NaÃŠÂ½Ã„?mÃ„?t (Ã˜Â£Ã™Â„Ã™Â†Ã˜Â¹Ã˜Â§Ã™Â…Ã˜Â©), les Estruces de Gallina.[17][Nota 5], 44033=En el 2004, un equip d'astrÃƒÂ²noms britÃƒÂ nics dirigits per Jane Greaves van descobrir que Tau Ceti tÃƒÂ© mÃƒÂ©s de deu vegades la quantitat de material cometari i asteroidal orbitant que la del sol. AixÃƒÂ² va ser determinat mesurant el disc de pols fred orbitant l'estrella produÃƒÂ¯t per colÃ‚Â·lisions entre petits cossos.[34] Aquest resultar posa un amortidor en la possibilitat de vida complexa en el sistema, ja que qualsevol planeta hauria patit de grans impactes astronÃƒÂ²mics aproximadament deu vegades la freqÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ¨ncia que la Terra. Greaves va observar durant la seva investigaciÃƒÂ³: ""ÃƒÂ©s el que [qualsevol planeta] pot experimentar del bombardejament constant d'asteroides del tipus que va acabar amb els dinosaures.""[35] Aquests bombardejaments haurien inhibit el desenvolupament de la biodiversitat entre impactes.[36] Malgrat aixÃƒÂ², ÃƒÂ©s possible que un gegant de gas de la mida de JÃƒÂºpiter pot desviar els cometes i asteroides.[34][Nota 8], 51895=Tau Ceti va ser un objectiu de diverses recerques planetÃƒÂ ries per velocitat radial. Fins al 1988, les observacions van descartar qualsevol variaciÃƒÂ³ periÃƒÂ²dica atribuÃƒÂ¯bles a planetes massius al voltant de Tau Ceti en distÃƒÂ ncia semblants a JÃƒÂºpiter.[39][40] Fins al desembre de 2012, es van realitzar mesuraments mÃƒÂ©s precisos que mai per descartar aquests planetes.[40] La precisiÃƒÂ³ de la velocitat va arribar als 11Ã‚Â m/s mesurats en un perÃƒÂ­ode de cinc anys.[41] Aquest resultat exclou la presÃƒÂ¨ncia de JÃƒÂºpiters calents, i probablement exclou qualsevol planeta amb una massa mÃƒÂ­nima mÃƒÂ©s gran o igual a la de JÃƒÂºpiter i en perÃƒÂ­odes orbitals inferiors a 15 anys.[42] A mÃƒÂ©s, un sondeig d'estrelles properes completat en 1999 realitzat per la Wide Field and Planetary Camera del Telescopi Espacial Hubble, incloent-hi una recerca de febles companys de Tau Ceti; va resultar que no es van descobrir resultats fins als lÃƒÂ­mits de la potÃƒÂ¨ncia del telescopi.[43], 47773=Tau Ceti mostra que les estrelles necessiten no perdre grans discs en aquesta edat i que un cinturÃƒÂ³ prim no pot ser comÃƒÂº en les estrelles semblants al sol.[37] El cinturÃƒÂ³ de Tau Ceti ÃƒÂ©s nomÃƒÂ©s 1Ã¢?Â„20a part tan dens com el cinturÃƒÂ³ del seu jove veÃƒÂ­, Epsilon Eridani.[34] La falta relativa de pols al voltant del sol pot ser el cas inusual: un membre de l'equip d'investigaciÃƒÂ³ suggereix que el sol pot haver passat a prop d'una altra estrella a principis de la seva histÃƒÂ²ria i va perdre la majoria dels cometes i asteroides.[35] Les estrelles amb grans discs de pols han alterat astronÃƒÂ²micament el pensament sobre la formaciÃƒÂ³ de planetes; les estrelles de discos de pols, on el seu material ÃƒÂ©s contÃƒÂ­nuament generat per colÃ‚Â·lisions, semblen formar planetes fÃƒÂ cilment.[37], 62157=El 19 de desembre de 2012, es van presentar proves que existeix un sistema de cinc planetes orbitant Tau Ceti.[52] La massa mÃƒÂ­nima dels planetes ÃƒÂ©s estimada entre dos a sis vegades la de la Terra, amb perÃƒÂ­odes que van de 14 a 640 dies.

En el 2002, els astrÃƒÂ²noms Margaret Turnbull i Jill Tarter van desenvolupar el Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems (HabCat) sota els auspicis del Projecte Phoenix, un altre esforÃƒÂ§ del SETI. La llista contÃƒÂ© mÃƒÂ©s de 17000 sistemes teÃƒÂ²ricament habitables, aproximadament el 10% de la mostra original.[48] El segÃƒÂ¼ent any, Turnbull va refinar la llista amb els 30 sistemes mÃƒÂ©s prometedors de 5000 en cent anys llum del sol, incloent Tau Ceti; aixÃƒÂ² forma part de les bases de recerca de rÃƒÂ dio amb l'Allen Telescope Array.[49] TambÃƒÂ© es va seleccionar a Tau Ceti en una curta llista de les cinc estrelles mÃƒÂ©s adequades per a les recerques (indefinidament ajornades)[50] El sistema de telescopis Terrestrial Planet Finder, va comentar que ""que aquests llocs serien bons per viure si DÃƒÂ©u posÃƒÂ©s el nostre planeta al voltant d'una altra estrella.""[51], 14008=Des del desembre de 2012, hi ha proves de cinc planetes orbitant Tau Ceti, i un d'ells pot estar potencialment en la zona habitable.[12][13] A causa del disc residual, qualsevol planeta que orbiti Tau Ceti pot patir mÃƒÂ©s impactes astronÃƒÂ²mics que la Terra. Malgrat aquest obstacle de l'habitabilitat, les seves caracterÃƒÂ­stiques com a anÃƒÂ leg solar (semblant al sol) han marcat l'interÃƒÂ¨s estÃƒÂ¨s per l'estrella. D'acord amb la seva estabilitat, semblanÃƒÂ§a i relativa proximitat al sol, Tau Ceti estÃƒÂ  sempre en la llista d'objectius pel projecte de la Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), i apareix en la literatura de ciÃƒÂ¨ncia-ficciÃƒÂ³.[14]}",,"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 18:37:46 GMT"

The decision for a larger sample sizes than needed for 1. was done with the intention to evaluate the secondary outcome measure, i.e., to assess the difference between the frequency of new or increased symptoms in patients treated for early Lyme disease and the occurrence of the same symptoms in control subjects. We assumed that the outcomes in the two treatment groups will be comparable and that the patients could be combined for further analysis. To obtain a control group from the same geographical area, each patient was asked if she or he had a family member or friend who was within 5 years of her or his age and who was without a history of Lyme borreliosis. These persons were approached by a short written explanation of the investigation, containing also a request for their participation. We assumed that we will be able to get a corresponding control person not for all but for approximately 80-90% of patients.

August 1943, hierbei wurde die britische Sloop Bideford beschÃƒÂ¤digt. Zwei Tage spÃƒÂ¤ter wurde mit einer Hs 293 die britische Sloop Egret versenkt. In der Folge entwickelte sich die Hs 293 zum erfolgreichsten deutschen LenkflugkÃƒÂ¶rper des Krieges. Mit ÃƒÂ¼ber 30 beschÃƒÂ¤digten oder versenkten Kriegsschiffen war sie bis zur EinfÃƒÂ¼hrung der Exocet der weltweit erfolgreichste SeezielflugkÃƒÂ¶rper. Auf ihr Konto gehen neben der Egret mehrere ZerstÃƒÂ¶rer (u. a. Janus) sowie zahlreiche Handelsschiffe. Am 26. November 1943 versenkte eine He 177 mit einer HS 293 den britischen Truppentransporter Rohna vor der algerischen KÃƒÂ¼ste. Von den insgesamt 2.195 Menschen an Bord kamen 1.138 (nach anderen Quellen 1.170) ums Leben, darunter 1015 US-amerikanische Soldaten. Es war der grÃƒÂ¶ÃƒÂŸte Menschenverlust der Amerikaner im Zweiten Weltkrieg auf See. FÃƒÂ¼r den Einsatz gegen schwerer gepanzerte Ziele, wie z.Ã‚Â B.

The advantage of this is that with a single CD you can install the software onto a computer, use a full set of tools to repair a damaged installation, or demonstrate the capabilities of the system without installing it. Daily snapshots are available from the master site for those who want to install the most recent versions of DragonFly without building from source.

Matthew Dillon, an Amiga developer in the late 1980s and early 1990s and a FreeBSD developer between 1994 and 2003, began work on DragonFly BSD in June 2003 and announced it on the FreeBSD mailing lists on 16 July 2003.[3], 14400=As support for multiple processor architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support,[6] DragonFly BSD now limits its support to the x86-64 platform.[11] DragonFly originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 it is no longer supported. Since version 1.10, DragonFly supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread),[12] which is regarded as a relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain.[8] Inherited from FreeBSD, DragonFly also supports multi-threading.[13], 26401=The initial implementation of Common Address Redundancy Protocol (commonly referred to as CARP) was finished in March 2007.[24] As of 2011, CARP support is integrated into DragonFly BSD.[25], 32187=As with FreeBSD and OpenBSD, the developers of DragonFly BSD are slowly replacing K&R style C code with more modern, ANSI equivalents. Similar to other operating systems, DragonFly's version of the GNU Compiler Collection has an enhancement called the Stack-Smashing Protector (ProPolice) enabled by default, providing some additional protection against buffer overflow based attacks. It should be noted that as of 23 July 2005[update], the kernel is no longer built with this protection by default.[31], 34213=Like the other BSD kernels (and those of most modern operating systems), DragonFly employs a built-in kernel debugger to help the developers find kernel bugs. Furthermore, as of October 2004[update], a debug kernel, which makes bug reports more useful for tracking down kernel-related problems, is installed by default, at the expense of a relatively small quantity of disk space. When a new kernel is installed, the backup copy of the previous kernel and its modules are stripped of their debugging symbols to further minimize disk space usage., 29747=In 2007 DragonFly BSD received a new device file system (devfs), which dynamically adds and removes device nodes, allows accessing devices by connection paths, recognises drives by serial numbers and removes the need for pre-populated /dev file system hierarchy.

Starting with a prologue in The Amazing Spider-Man #698 and ending in The Amazing Spider-Man #700, ""Dying Wish"" brought over fifty years of Marvel's publication of The Amazing Spider-Man comic series to an end, and ushered in the new series The Superior Spider-Man in January 2013. The story concluded a storyline started in The Amazing Spider-Man #600 where it is revealed that the Spider-Man villain Doctor Octopus is terminally ill from his years of crime and fighting superheroes. Aware of his impending death, Doctor Octopus sets in motion a series of plans to create his legacy, that ran through the March 2012 story ""Ends of the Earth"" and finished in ""Dying Wish"", where the villain successfully swapped consciousnesses with Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker, thrusting the hero into his decaying body., 10579=Starting in The Amazing Spider-Man #698 (November 2012), Doctor Octopus remains incarcerated in the Raft. Roused from an inactive state, he struggles to utter the words ""Peter Parker"".[6] Elsewhere, Spider-Man is shown working through his day, while his inner monologue details him living up to his full potential as a scientist and a man, including romantically reuniting with Mary Jane Watson.[7] Responding to Octopus' calls for Spider-Man's alter ego, he goes to his ailing villain's bedside.[8] ""Spider-Man"" reveals that at an unspecified point, the pair swapped consciousnesses: Octopus has transferred himself into Parker's body and vice versa using a special remote controlled Octobot.[9][10] Octopus intends to live Parker's life and let Parker die in Octopus' body.[11], 7271=Images containing the major story reveals of The Amazing Spider-Man #698 and #700 were leaked before their commercial release.[1] The controversial ending of The Amazing Spider-Man #700 was leaked on December 14, 2012, twelve days before the issue's December 26 release date and four days before retailers were to receive the issue. Slott responded to the leak by asking readers to wait for the full comic and experience the ending in context.[1] When writing #698, Slott struggled with writing the dialog for Doctor Octopus in Peter Parker's body, wanting to convey a subtle difference ""weird enough that you kind of go, 'Man, they're not getting Peter's voice right this issue'"", without giving away the reveal that the two had switched bodies.[2], 9006=In The Amazing Spider-Man #600 (July 2009), Doctor Octopus is revealed to be dying from the injuries he has sustained from a career of fighting superheroes, particularly Spider-Man. This sets in motion a series of plans first aimed at saving his life (in the 2010 storyline ""Origin of the Species"") and later at wiping out over seven billion people so that he will be remembered for his infamy (in the 2012 storyline ""Ends of the Earth"").[3] Octopus is foiled in his attempts and following ""Ends of the Earth"", he is incarcerated in the Raft and left waiting death in a life-support machine.[4][5], 22770=The first installment of the story in The Amazing Spider-Man #698 sold an estimated 81,350 issues in its initial run, an increase of 21,472 from the previous issue's estimated 59,878 sales.[40] Sales of Issue #699 fell slightly to 74,901, but Issue #700 sold 200,957 units, making it the number 1 selling comic of December,[41] and according to North American comic distributor Diamond Comic Distributors (DCD) it was the fourth best selling comic of 2012, followed by #698 at number 94 and #699 at number 130, and the tie-in issue #699.1 at number 182.[42], 13829=In The Amazing Spider-Man #700 (December 2012), Octopus learns of Parker's escape and attempts to leave the country long enough for his body to die.[16] Meanwhile the Trapster uses various technologies to prolong Parker's life.[17] An electric shock delivered during the process causes Parker to experience a vision of the afterlife where he meets the people he has lost, including Gwen Stacy and Uncle Ben. Ben encourages Parker to put a stop to Octopus, and Parker awakens in the real world.[18] Octopus decides to remain in New York City and gather all of Parker's loved ones together in Avengers Tower.[19] While Parker attempts to repair the recovered golden Octobot, Octopus sends law enforcement after him.[20] To prevent his villainous companions from harming the police, Parker incapacitates Trapster and escapes with Scorpion and Hydro-Man.[21] Together they infiltrate Avengers Tower, but they are confronted by Octopus.[22] Learning that J. Jonah Jameson is also in the tower, Scorpion and Hydro-Man abandon Parker to pursue Scorpion's agenda against Jameson.[23] When Scorpion attempts to kill Jameson's father's wife, Parker's Aunt May, Octopus intervenes to protect her and experiences a flash of Parker's childhood memory of his aunt.[24] As Scorpion attacks him again, Octopus overreacts and punches off Scorpion's jaw.[25] Seeing that Octopus has almost killed someone using his body, Parker grabs Octopus and jumps out of a window in an attempt to kill them both.[26] Octopus manages to form a cushion from webbing, saving them both.[27] Parker takes control of the Octobot and strikes Octopus, but it fails to work; Octopus reveals he added shielding to the area to prevent another transfer.[28] As Octopus prepares to finish Parker, Parker uses their connection via the bot to intentionally inflict his memories on Octopus, from his childhood to the multitudinous losses he has experienced and his transformation into Spider-Man, but modifying the memories to feature Octopus in Parker's place.[29] The memories subdue Octopus and make him realize the error of his ways. He promises to keep the people safe as Parker finally dies.[30] In the final scene, Octopus promises that with his ambition and intelligence, he will be a Superior Spider-Man.[31], 12398=In The Amazing Spider-Man #699 (December 2012), doctors struggle to keep Parker alive as Octopus' body continues to fail.[12] As Parker contemplates the evil that Octopus may be doing as Spider-Man, he realizes he has access to Octopus' memories and learns of the golden Octobot and how it rewrote his brain patterns with Octopus'.[13] Using Octopus' body's remote mental connection to the Octobot, he controls and uses it to summon a group of supervillains to the Raft to free him.[14] Hydro-Man, Scorpion and the Trapster free Parker, believing him to be Octopus, and he begins a plan to capture Octopus.[15], 5062=The story was controversial, concluding with the death of Parker in Octopus' body, and Octopus surviving as the now Superior Spider-Man. ""Dying Wish"" encompassed some of the best selling comics of 2012, with issue #700 listed as the 4th best selling comic of the year.}",,"Sat, 25 Jul 2015 13:13:52 GMT"

Raza Odiada ha sido un disco que ha dado muchos de los clÃƒÂ¡sicos del grupo: ""La Migra"", ""La Ley De Plomo"" (de estos dos se filmaron videoclips que resultaron ser un ÃƒÂ©xito en canales de mÃƒÂºsica anglosajones como MTV), ""Colas de Rata"", ""Echando Chingasos"", ""RevoluciÃƒÂ³n"", etc., 15995=Brujeria se formÃƒÂ³ en una fiesta a manera de banda de broma, en el aÃƒÂ±o 1989, ÃƒÂ©poca en la cual existÃƒÂ­a gran discriminaciÃƒÂ³n hacia los metaleros hispanoamericanos en los conciertos de metal en la escena del heavy metal. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, la mayorÃƒÂ­a de los grupos extremos de la zona cantaban en inglÃƒÂ©s, por lo cual sus fundadores decidieron crear una banda de grindcore y death metal que representara a la comunidad hispana, con letras explÃƒÂ­citas y en espaÃƒÂ±ol. Sus integrantes, el guitarrista Asesino (Dino Cazares), el Director DiabÃƒÂ³lico ""Jr Hozicon"" (Jello Biafra), el baterÃƒÂ­a Fantasma (Pat Hoed), el bajista GÃƒÂ¼ero sin Fe (Billy Gould) y el vocalista Juan Brujo (John Lepe), utilizaron seudÃƒÂ³nimos ya que la mayorÃƒÂ­a de ellos eran miembros de otros conocidos grupos de metal. La banda fue criticada desde sus inicios a causa de sus letras sobre narcotrÃƒÂ¡fico, sexo y satanismo. Lo anterior es debido a que el concepto principal de la banda fue inspirado por la historia que horrorizÃƒÂ³ a MÃƒÂ©xico y al mundo el 11 de abril de 1989 en el Rancho Santa Elena, en Matamoros, ya que fue el lugar donde hubo operaciones satÃƒÂ¡nicas por parte del narcotrÃƒÂ¡fico para que su actividad ilÃƒÂ­cita pasara inadvertida por las autoridades y para ello realizaban sacrificios humanos en ritos y misas negras [1]., 27354=IncreÃƒÂ­blemente, el ÃƒÂ¡lbum fue un ÃƒÂ©xito de ventas y mÃƒÂ¡s extraordinario aÃƒÂºn, fue nominado para los Grammy Latinos del 2001 en la categorÃƒÂ­a de ""Mejor Ãƒ?lbum de Rock"".

En octubre de 2014 se firmÃƒÂ³ con el sello Nuclear Blast para un ÃƒÂ¡lbum en 2015 ., 20646=Fue polÃƒÂ©mica la portada de su primer disco de larga duraciÃƒÂ³n -ya con Roadrunner Records-, Matando GÃƒÂ¼eros (1993), en la que se podÃƒÂ­a ver una cabeza separada de un cuerpo y a medio quemar, tambiÃƒÂ©n una mano sosteniÃƒÂ©ndola por el cabello. Posteriormente, la imagen de esta cabeza se convertirÃƒÂ­a en un emblema de la banda, transfigurÃƒÂ¡ndola en su mascota conocida como Coco Loco (idea similar al Eddie de Iron Maiden). Gracias a este disco y a los rumores que generÃƒÂ³, BrujerÃƒÂ­a se hizo mÃƒÂ¡s popular. En este ÃƒÂ¡lbum se integra El Hongo (Shane Embury) al bajo para formar la alineaciÃƒÂ³n definitiva de la banda hasta el 2000., 38750=Entre abril y junio de 2008 regresaron a Europa para hacer unas presentaciones como una extensiÃƒÂ³n de la gira ""Arma del Cambio Tour"", las cuales incluyeron fechas en ""SWR MetaFestXI"" en Barriselas, Portugal, nuevamente en ""ViÃƒÂ±aRock 2008"" en Albacete, EspaÃƒÂ±a y en ""Kobetasonik"", que es un festival de rock que se realiza en el PaÃƒÂ­s Vasco, (EspaÃƒÂ±a). Para los meses de noviembre y diciembre de ese aÃƒÂ±o, la banda iniciÃƒÂ³ nueva gira conocida como ""No Acceptan Imitaciones Tour"", la cual estaba conformada por la misma alineaciÃƒÂ³n pero que en esta ocasiÃƒÂ³n contÃƒÂ³ con el regreso del Pinche Peach para retomar la tercera voz, mÃƒÂ¡s la incorporaciÃƒÂ³n permanente en la gira de Pititis en la voz femenina y las colaboraciones de Mil Mecos y El niÃƒÂ±o como miembros de equipo para dicha gira, la cual inicio el 28 de novimebre en Denver, Colorado, USA y conluyÃƒÂ³ el 7 de diciembre en Dallas Texas, USA. La presentaciÃƒÂ³n que se tenÃƒÂ­a contemplada para cierre de esta gira era en el primer Brufest que se realizarÃƒÂ­a el 14 de diciembre de ese aÃƒÂ±o en MÃƒÂ©xico D.F. pero fue cancelado, por motivos ajenos a la banda..en este primer Brufest se tenÃƒÂ­a confirmadas bandas como Napalm Death y Brutal Truth como parte del cartel de dicho evento., 35139=DespuÃƒÂ©s de esto la banda se ausentÃƒÂ³ bastante tiempo de los escenarios y la incertidumbre sobre el futuro del grupo se vuelve incierto, se especulÃƒÂ³ que el motivo de esto era por que se encontraban trabajando en un nuevo ÃƒÂ¡lbum, pero solo se trataban de rumores. AdemÃƒÂ¡s en este lapso de tiempo varios integrantes esenciales del grupo, como Asesino (Dino Cazares), alegaban diferencias con Juan Brujo (John Lepe) y partÃƒÂ­an por rumbos separados. En 2006 vuelve a haber noticias de la banda con el lanzamiento de ""The Singles"", el cual es un relanzamiento de los EP y singles de la banda, asÃƒÂ­ como el inicio de una nueva gira de conciertos mundiales conocido como: ""No Seas Pendejo Tour"" que iniciÃƒÂ³ en Buenos Aires, Argentina el 28 de enero y que tambiÃƒÂ©n incluyÃƒÂ³ su presentaciÃƒÂ³n en el Vive Latino 2006 en MÃƒÂ©xico presentando a dos nuevos miembros: Angelito (Tony Laureano) en la baterÃƒÂ­a y El Cynico (Jeff Walker) al bajo, El Hongo (Shane Embury) deja el bajo y se recorriÃƒÂ³ a la guitarra. AsÃƒÂ­ como su primera presentaciÃƒÂ³n en Europa (ViÃƒÂ±a Rock, EspaÃƒÂ±a), concluyo esta gira el 6 de agosto de ese aÃƒÂ±o en Houston Texas, USA. Posteriormente en septiembre de ese aÃƒÂ±o regresan a hacer un pequeÃƒÂ±o tour en EspaÃƒÂ±a conocido como ""Don Quijote Marijuana Tour"" ahora con El Embrujado (Patrik Jensen) a la guitarra y El Podrido (Adrian Erlandsson) en la baterÃƒÂ­a., 33214=Pero es hasta el 2 de octubre de 2003 que la banda dio su primer concierto oficial en Chicago USA, e inicia su primera gira ÃƒÂ³ ""Misas"" conocidas como ""The Mexicutioner Tour"", misma que concluyeron hasta el 24 de enero del 2004 en Guadalajara MÃƒÂ©xico, abarrotando las taquillas y agotando los boletos. En este tour, la alineaciÃƒÂ³n estaba formada por: Juan Brujo (John Lepe) en voz, Fantasma (Pat Hoed) en la segunda voz, Pinche Peach tercera voz, Asesino (Dino Cazares) en guitarra, Hongo (Shane Embury) al bajo y El Sadistico (Emilio Marquez) en la baterÃƒÂ­a. AsÃƒÂ­ mismo en el 2003, Roadrunner Records lanza un nuevo recopilatorio de temas de los discos de estudio de la banda, ahora bajo el nombre de ""The Mexecutioner: The Best Of BrujerÃƒÂ­a"", por lo que la banda ahora con Hongo Jr. (Nicholas Barker) en la baterÃƒÂ­a, deciden promocionar el trabajo cosa que jamÃƒÂ¡s hicieron antes, eso incluÃƒÂ­a dar entrevistas, conciertos, etc. Arrancando con un Segundo Tour ""Tour II"" que iniciarÃƒÂ­a el 7 de febrero de 2004 en Mexicali (en esta presentaciÃƒÂ³n participÃƒÂ³ Pititis), asÃƒÂ­ como su primera visita a los paÃƒÂ­ses de Brasil y Argentina, concluyendo la gira el 8 de agosto de ese aÃƒÂ±o en Buenos Aires., 21835=Tras un par de aÃƒÂ±os de receso, varios de sus integrantes tenÃƒÂ­an compromisos con sus grupos principales; en 1994 publicaron un EP tributo a Pablo Escobar, uno de los mayores traficantes de cocaÃƒÂ­na del mundo y que falleciÃƒÂ³ en 1993, titulado ""El PatrÃƒÂ³n"". Gracias a este trabajo, se dice que incluso la DEA los tuvo entre sus hombres mÃƒÂ¡s buscados. No obstante, todas las partes implicadas han desmentido siempre este hecho., 28147=Tras este tercer trabajo, el grupo quedÃƒÂ³ en segundo plano, centrÃƒÂ¡ndose sus componentes en sus proyectos, ya fueran los de siempre y los nuevos (como el de Asesino), por lo que la actividad se limitÃƒÂ³ a la publicaciÃƒÂ³n de un disco recopilatorio, el cual saliÃƒÂ³ inmediatamente titulado Mextremist Hits!, lanzado en 2001, en el que se incluyeron sus clÃƒÂ¡sicos temas, algunos revisados (Matando GÃƒÂ¼eros 97), remixes (Mecosaurio - Pinche Peach Remix, Marijuana - Escobar Remix, etc), una pista multimedia con videos, y algunos temas nuevos, como la bizarra colaboraciÃƒÂ³n de Mucho Muchacho en el tema ""Narco-peda"", o el tema ""Asesino"", que serÃƒÂ­a una tentativa al proyecto de Asesino, donde colabora Tony Campos de Static-X., 24377=En 1999 vio la luz ""Spanglish 101"", una compilaciÃƒÂ³n de su discogrÃƒÂ¡fica Kool Arrow Records, protestando contra el predominio del inglÃƒÂ©s. En este material la banda lanzÃƒÂ³ un par de temas nuevos: ""Marcha de Odio"" (el cual serÃƒÂ­a incluido mÃƒÂ¡s tarde en su siguiente material, Brujerizmo) y ""Don Quijote Marijuana"", un tema que captaba la atenciÃƒÂ³n por su extraÃƒÂ±o estilo, completamente diferente al metal tÃƒÂ­pico del grupo, siendo un tema techno-dance-metal, y por su singular videoclip. El tema en cuestiÃƒÂ³n era una versiÃƒÂ³n del ya de por sÃƒÂ­ bizarro ""Don Quichotte"" del ochentero grupo de tecnopop francÃƒÂ©s Magazine 60., 37437=Para el 2007 Juan Brujo (John Lepe) - voz, Fantasma (Pat Hoed) - segunda voz, El Cynico (Jeff Walker) - bajo, Hongo (Shane Embury) - guitarra y El podrido (Adrian Erlandsson) - baterÃƒÂ­a, inician una nueva gira conocida como ""Arma del Cambio Tour"" que inicia el 21 de febrero, la cual incluyÃƒÂ³ fechas en Inglaterra, Italia, EspaÃƒÂ±a, Francia, Alemania, USA, MÃƒÂ©xico, Colombia, Argentina, Brasil, PerÃƒÂº, Chile y Ecuador concluyendo el 15 de diciembre de ese aÃƒÂ±o. Cabe mencionar que Brujo y companÃƒÂ­a se hicieron una pequeÃƒÂ±a presentaciÃƒÂ³n en el tiangÃƒÂ¼is cultural del Chopo en MÃƒÂ©xico DF, como lo han hecho muchas bandas under, es decir de forma gratuita y al aire libre., 9129=BrujerÃƒÂ­a es un supergrupo de grindcore mexicano conformado en 1989., 32395=BrujerÃƒÂ­a rehusÃƒÂ³ realizar presentaciones en vivo en sus primeros aÃƒÂ±os, no obstante el 11 de junio de 1997 aparecen Juan Brujo (John Lepe) en la voz, Fantasma (Pat Hoed) con el bajo y la segunda voz, Pinche Peach en la tercera voz y Asesino (Dino Cazares) en la guitarra (se desconoce quiÃƒÂ©n toco la BaterÃƒÂ­a) en el Ã¢Â€Âœwhiskey a go goÃ¢Â€? de Hollywood, CA presentando un pequeÃƒÂ±o concierto mismo que fue incorporado en el (EP) de ""Marijuana"" como lado B., 41316=En una entrevista reciente (junio de 2009) con el bajista Shane Embury, el 4.Ã‚Âº ÃƒÂ¡lbum de estudio de la banda deberÃƒÂ¡ estar listo a finales de este aÃƒÂ±o, haciendo probable que sea lanzado en la primera mitad de 2010. Embury tambiÃƒÂ©n asegurÃƒÂ³ que podrÃƒÂ­a ser publicado por la banda misma, es decir, de forma independiente. SerÃƒÂ­a su primer material de larga duraciÃƒÂ³n inÃƒÂ©dito en 10 aÃƒÂ±os, especÃƒÂ­ficamente desde ""BrujerÃƒÂ­zmo"" del 2000., 29811=El 2002 llegÃƒÂ³ con muchos planes para la banda, por un lado se metieron de lleno a grabar material nuevo para su tan esperado cuarto ÃƒÂ¡lbum, que en un principio los rumores decÃƒÂ­an que se titularÃƒÂ­a SatÃƒÂ¡n Te Ama, que finalmente fue falso., 26028=En el aÃƒÂ±o 2000 sale, despuÃƒÂ©s de 5 aÃƒÂ±os del ÃƒÂºltimo larga duraciÃƒÂ³n, Brujerizmo, en la cual se encuentra la incorporaciÃƒÂ³n de Hongo Jr (Nicholas Barker) como segundo baterÃƒÂ­sta, Cristo de Pisto (Jesse Pintado) en la guitarra rÃƒÂ¡pida y Pititis (Gaby DomÃƒÂ­nguez) en la voz femenina, aumentando el nÃƒÂºmero de integrantes del grupo. En este ÃƒÂ¡lbum aparecen canciones como ""Vayan sin miedo"", ""DivisiÃƒÂ³n del Norte"", ""Anti-Castro"", ""Laboratorio Cristalitos"" o ""Pititis te Invoco"". En dicho disco se ve claramente hacia donde ha evolucionado el grupo y cuenta con uno de los mejores sonidos que ha tenido la banda. Abarca temas polÃƒÂ­ticos, sobre drogasÃ¢Â€Â¦ en la misma lÃƒÂ­nea de sus anteriores discos, pero puestos al dÃƒÂ­a. Sin ser un mal trabajo, Brujerizmo no fue capaz de ponerse a la altura de sus antecesores, pero es que ÃƒÂ©stos dejaron las expectativas demasiado altas., 42319=DespuÃƒÂ©s de varios aÃƒÂ±os de parÃƒÂ³, y problemas internos , Brujeria se reformÃƒÂ³ en 2007 y decidiÃƒÂ³ que era hora de volver a la escena . Juan Brujo ( voz), Pat Hoed ( segunda voz), Jeff Walker (bajo), Shane Embury ( guitarra) y Adrian Erlandsson (baterÃƒÂ­a ) comenzaron una nueva gira llamada "" Weapon of Change Tour"". Duradera del 21 de febrero al 15 de diciembre, la banda se presentÃƒÂ³ en Inglaterra, Italia, EspaÃƒÂ±a, Francia, Alemania, EE.UU., MÃƒÂ©xico, Colombia, Argentina, Brasil, PerÃƒÂº, Chile y Ecuador. Entre abril y junio de 2008, Brujeria regresÃƒÂ³ a Europa para dar algunos conciertos como una extensiÃƒÂ³n de la "" Weapon of Change Tour"", incluyendo las fechas en SWR Metalfest XI en Barroselas (Portugal), de nuevo ViÃƒÂ±a Rock (Albacete, EspaÃƒÂ±a) y en Kobetasonik que es un festival de rock que se lleva a cabo en el PaÃƒÂ­s Vasco (EspaÃƒÂ±a). En noviembre y diciembre de ese aÃƒÂ±o, la banda comenzÃƒÂ³ una nueva gira llamada "" No acepte imitaciones Tour"" . Brujeria tocÃƒÂ³ en la 10 Ã‚Âª anual Maryland Death Fest en mayo de 2012., 40577=Tras varios aÃƒÂ±os sin un disco nuevo, por problemas internos, el grupo se reforma en 2007 y decidiÃƒÂ³ que ya era hora de devolver a la escena todo lo que esta le habÃƒÂ­a dado. Por este motivo, decidieron hacer otras giras mundiales entre 2007 y 2008. Si bien, con este gesto han perdido una pizca de misterio, sobre todo porque la formaciÃƒÂ³n ha cambiado muchÃƒÂ­simo y porque BrujerÃƒÂ­a era reacio a dar conciertos. No obstante, actualmente se encuentran activos, y en 2008, despuÃƒÂ©s de tantos rumores la banda se ha encontrado trabajando en un material nuevo, gracias al lanzamiento de un single nuevo, ""Debilador"", que tocaron por vez primera en sus conciertos del 2007.}",,"Mon, 13 Jul 2015 19:13:24 GMT"

If a non-KDE source package, the source repository will be checked-out into %DOWNLOADDIR%\svn-src, e.g. Qt source may be found in C:\kderoot\download\svn-src\qt. If a binary package, this will be downloaded into the DOWNLOADDIR defined in your kdesettings.bat, which is usually %KDEROOT%\download. The --fetch action will retrieve either a binary or the source code for the package: emerge packageName performs the separate actions --fetch, --unpack, --compile, --install, and --qmerge. What emerge does Every time you want to update or install a package, you should first update your emerge checkout (simply run emerge --update emerge) to ensure you are using the latest package recipies. It is strongly recommended you do not choose to manually install any of the utilities and libraries yourself, as you may install the wrong version and cause installation failures. Instead allow emerge to resolve the dependencies for you. Note that this will install the development version of KDE (trunk in svn repositories, master in git repositories), if you wish to install a particular stable branch then you should change the branch of emerge to the specific branch of that release. NOTE:","Hints Updating packages Once you have packagename built, type emerge --update packagename to update packagename from the Subversion and compile it without removing the build dir or emerge --update-all to update all packages that can be rebuild (they are rebuild with --update). General setup For Fine Tuning see here: Fine-tuning Notes emerge can mostly cooperate with the kdewin-installer but we're currently still working on some packages which are packaged in a wrong way. It is not recommended to use another layout then installer for directory_layout in the kdesettings.bat anymore (see that file for more detailed information). emerge creates lots of files in \kderoot\tmp during build. After a package is successfully installed (check \kderoot\etc\portage\installed or the directory \kderoot\manifest\), you can delete its temporary directory. Windows emerge is derived from the Gentoo portage system, but we are currently not enforcing compatibility.

Known Issues Detected by Upgrade Advisor For general information about support for DTS in Integration Services, see Support for SQL Server 2000 DTS in SQL Server 2008 R2. After migrating packages, migrated packages should be opened to check for issues, including validation failures. For example, some packages rely on preceding tasks within the same package to create or prepare data sources or data destinations, and may fail validation when these objects cannot be located. A validation failure of this sort can be resolved by setting the DelayValidation property to true on the task or other container object, or by setting the ValidateExternalMetadata property to false on the affected data flow component.

OCaml's let is non-recursive by default, but has the form let rec for defining recursive functions. OCaml is strict by default, although it has some facility for introducing laziness. 1 Conceptual differences This page aims to cover some of its differences from Haskell. OCaml is a functional programming language in the ML family, an extension of the Caml language with object-oriented constructs.

When it comes to funding these schemes, who pays what? Who pays what? Following the breakdown of negotiations between the government and trade unions, public sector workers went on strike last month in the biggest day of industrial action since the late Seventies. requiring members to pay higher contributions. basing future pension uplifts on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, rather than the higher Retail Prices Index (RPI); and paying pensions based on career-average earnings, rather than final salaries; bringing normal retirement ages for public-sector workers into line with the State Pension; In order to curb the cost of providing generous pensions to government workers, the coalition has proposed a number of changes to future pension entitlements. These include: Then again, while nearly four-fifths (79%) of workers are in the private sector, almost seven-tenths (70%) of those with final-salary pensions work in the public sector. Thus, in an independent review of public-sector pensions, Lord Hutton warned that this public-private pensions apartheid was ""fundamentally unfair"". Today, the UK has 29 million workers: 23 million working in the private sector and six million working in the public sector. Pensions apartheid In order to provide guaranteed pensions based on salary and length of service, final-salary pensions require yearly contributions of up to 30% of","* These are members' gross contributions, which will be reduced by tax relief of 20% to 50%. As you can see, teachers pay 6.4% of their before-tax salary into their pension scheme and taxpayers contribute 14.1%, for a total of 20.5%. These are broadly in line with the contribution rates into similar private-sector schemes. However, civil servants pay a mere 1.5% of pay into their pensions, with taxpayers contributing 18.9%. The Armed Forces pay nothing into their pensions, with all 29.4% of pay coming directly from taxpayers. However, given that our servicemen and women must put their lives on the line in hostile conditions, often for low pay, I would argue that those who serve also deserve decent pensions! Finally, the pension scheme for Britain's judges is obscenely generous. Members of the judiciary pay in 1.8% of salary, while taxpayers contribute a further 32.2%. Another question worth answering is: for every Ã‚Â£1 members pay in, how much do taxpayers contribute? My second table answers this question: Armed Forces Completely funded by taxpayers Teachers Ã‚Â£2.20 Civil Service Ã‚Â£12.60 Judges Ã‚Â£17.86 As you can see, for every Ã‚Â£1 teachers contribute, taxpayers add Ã‚Â£2.20. Civil servants pay in Ã‚Â£1 and get another Ã‚Â£12.60 from taxpayers. Lastly, the contribution from taxpayers is nearly 18 times that from judges. Surely you're joking, Mr Justice?

Aunque no existe un lÃƒÂ­mite definido en cuanto al nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces que deberÃƒÂ­a incluir en una pÃƒÂ¡gina, es mejor limitar el nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces a 200 por pÃƒÂ¡gina.
