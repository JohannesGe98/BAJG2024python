t_ED7 ~H嵰\_+o<r. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

If you are considering to attend USC, there are a few helpful tips. 1. Review your financial aid package carefully and make sure you receive as much aid as possible. Tuition should not discourage you from pursuing an education at USC. 2. Make sure USC knows all the majors you are interested in and join a school that will best represent you (e.g. Marshall School of Business for any type of business major). 3. USC has a network of alumni and recruiters that are looking to help you excel in the subject of your interest. 4.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Very, very daunting. $52,000/year including housing/meal plan/tuition, its not an inexpensive opportunity. However the USC Financial Aid Office is very understanding and very accessible.

As one that's academically inclined I was pretty surprised to see the lack of a Quiz Bowl team.

If you didn't end up getting a scholarship, USC is still a good deal. USC connections are huge, USC boasts an extremely wide alumni network, rising quickly in donations which just means that the alumni are more successful. Bang for buck seriously depends on major, I feel. Some areas of study have much better faculty than others - math and physics seem to not have fantastic professors, at least at the lower levels, but it doesn't get significantly better at the higher levels. Class sizes aren't necessarily small, as a sophomore I've yet to have a lecture with less than 40~50 people in it. For the academically hungry however you will feel a sense that the others are somewhat lacking in the same drive you have. Ultimately I have to give USC an average rating."", ""I'm not one to get plastered every week but that does happen very frequently at USC, as I mentioned it has a heavy Greek presence but that's slowly changing. You can do whatever you want for fun, there's a huge amount of clubs and it's pretty easy to make your own club if you don't find any of the hundreds to your liking, rec sports are fun, USC football exists (I say exists, instead of is a great watch this year...) and it IS Los Angeles so if you have an idea, head over to Google and you can probably find your thing on or off campus."", ""USC has stepped up its meal plan buffet-cafes, of which there are 3 now: Cafe 84, EVK, and Parkside. They're all about the same quality but have different features, with admittedly average-tier food for an absurd price if you do the calculations. The required freshman meal plan is standard-college-really-expensive which comes out to be around 15 dollars every meal if you eat every single meal every day within these 3 places, and trust me you live in LA, you will likely not be doing that. The metro rail has opened up this year, so you can actually get around LA fine especially in groups (though it can get a bit sketchy, and metro rail closes, so you must make sure you get back in time and stuff). Near campus foods: there is plenty of fast food, some average~below average sit down places, nothing spectacular. For the LA food experience you have to go downtown, obviously."", ""Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC.

Teaching quality is about average, ratemyprofessor ratings agree but that means add a few points to the school rating since there's a bias for people who rate there to dislike their teacher. In terms of rigor, teachers recognize engineering classes may be hard, the curves are fairly nice for all classes that aren't pre-med, so biology majors lose out on that regard. No words for business. Computer science is bothersome with the first several classes requiring a 95 for an A, no curves - so good luck in that.

Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free.

Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated.

And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored.

Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet.

Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school.

There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere.

However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college.

Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

This is a university to learn, not to prove you know everything already. Tips for prospective students 1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors.

Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing tX]^rA0iyIWo help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career.

The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships.

Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future.

The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships.

Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships.

Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships.

Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors.

Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university. Bang for the buck USC's tuition is very daunting. Very, very daunting. $52,000/year including housing/meal plan/tuition, its not an inexpensive opportunity. However the USC Financial Aid Office is very understanding and very accessible.

Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible -",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite towWrᵍY[_q1
=@l their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible -",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

The average student works hard at school and is involved in some type of club during the week. Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer",True,0,0,

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships.

Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Most of the classes are small enough that you'll feel right at home in no time and know all of your classmates and professors well. On weekends, you'll most likely party at night and visit downtown LA or the beach on weekends. There's so much to do both on campus and off that you'll never be bored. Despite the rumor that USC is full of stuck-up rich kids, this is NOT true. USC has some of the most friendly and cool people you'll ever meet. There isn't a particular stereotype for students, so everyone fits in! Trust me, you'll love USC if you like having fun and don't mind working hard. Tips for prospective students Do as much as possible in high school!! Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams.

Probably the most popular meeting place. There's an inverted fountain between Bing and Norris Theater, which face each other, so the people inside can keep an eye on each other. Alumni Park is home to an extremely large population of squirrels and trees from every state in the US., 9503=1) Apply by December 1st This will allow you to be applicable for most of the school sponsored scholarships, including the Presidential and Trustee Scholarships. Alumni Association Scholarships must be approached to the branch you live in (i.e. Houston, New York, Los Angeles, etc.) 2) Make an effort to visit the campus Especially for music and theater students, meet the professors. A little known fact for music students is that you can email the professor (at least 2 weeks in advance) and ask for a mock lesson and most times they do it for free. 3) They want a well rounded student body, not necessarily the well rounded student SPECIALIZE. Not everyone can be the best at everything. Be exceptional at something that sets you apart and use that as your tool to get into this university., 740126=Don't miss Trojan tailgates and football games!, 733940=Great for any students. Even though, USC is larger than most universities, you still run into a lot of people you know, which creates this close-knit Trojan family. Join the family, be happy, and have fun., 668681=USC has become my second home; despite the personal setbacks that I have faced while attending USC, my Trojan family has stood by me 100% and I would not be who I am today if I attended any other college. My peers and faculty have all been amazing to work with and have helped me grow tremendously., 179043=I just recently visited USC on August 29th and I was mesmerized! The campus was HUGE and gorgeous. It has the old style buildings I've always dreamed of in a college. The library was amazing, the tracks and gyms were appealing, and there was an abundance of bikes there. There's also convenient shuttle and taxi transportation for free. Students can enjoy the campus life by joining clubs, attending sporting events, and exploring the vast campus!, 619228=USC is very expensive but I believe it is an investment in my future. The academic programs are phenomenal, great facilities, amazing networking, beautiful weather, wonderful people,and great Trojan spirit!!, 692174=For those of you who are interested in this University, remember that the Trojan Network is an admirable connection that will bring you closer to your goals, true friends and future., 643734=During football season theres a week called conquest where it's the week before the UCLA game. Trojan Knights protect the Tommy Trojan statue by duct-taping it and guarding it 24/7 to make sure Bruins don't pull any pranks. Also, during the last week of school in May, seniors usually run around campus on a certain night and do the fountain run. They put on any ridiculous looking pool gear they can find and run around campus and jump into the fountains. It's a silly tradition and lately USC has been blocking of the fountains from being used but the seniors always find a way., 618603=Willing to work hard Want to be a part of the Trojan family, 430838=Goal-oriented & motivated. Most of the kids here want something, and not just abstract knowledge. The five traits of a Trojan are that one must be faithful, scholarly, skillful, courageous, and ambitious. We take that stuff seriously. If you want to go places, and not an abstract go places, but real ambition, and you can back it up with courage, skill, a dedication to academics, and faith, here could very well be the place for you., 293308=Well Trojan Spirit is not something experienced at every school. At USC it will become part of who you are. Its exciting!, 361484=The atmosphere of the school is incredible. I am inspired everyday by the quality and ambition of the students here. There is a deep sense of pride in being a USC Trojan., 233608=This school is flooded with networks and connections in any field. There is a great sense of school spirit and Trojan community within the school and alumni. Football isn't everything, but it's pretty darn close to it., 854238=The University of Southern California is the epitome of a school that works hard and plays hard. Here, you'll find all the rigor and academic excellence of an Ivy League school, but without the stiffness. We pride ourselves on having a Trojan family that will take care of you no matter how long ago you graduated, and it couldn't be more true: once a Trojan, you're a Trojan for life., 157078=Make sure in the supplement of your essay that you write exactly why you want to attend USC. Colleges like it when they know you actually want to go to their school for some specific reasons, because it means they're doing something right. So make sure to include that, and if you're looking for a scholarship from the university, then make sure to apply by the December 1st deadline., 288721=USC is big on school spirit--which adds to the welcoming atmosphere. It creates a bond with every student on and off campus. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan., 23330=1. Apply by December 1st You can still apply to USC after December 1st (The second deadline is in January.) However, I would encourage students to apply by December 1st in order to be considered for scholarships. And even if you don't receive one, your application would already by done, and you can enjoy Winter Break without stressing about it. 2. Apply for Financial Aid. If you do not receive a scholarship from USC, make sure to apply for financial aid. And even if you do, apply for it if you don't get a full scholarship. As stated before, USC is very good at giving financial aid, and will give you more if the first amount is not enough. You will need to send it a lot of papers, especially your parents' if you are still an independent. Nevertheless, it is worth it to receive any sort of financial aid. 3. Ask Questions, Do Research. During my freshman year, I learned things that would have been very helpful as a high school graduate going into college. Quiet frankly, my high school did not prepare me at all. No one told me that if I wanted to be pre-med/pre-pharm, I don't have to be a science major. As long as I take the required courses (and MCATS if I am pre-med), I can apply for medical or pharmacy school. Having a science degree helps, but it is not required. I know a person who is a business major and planning on going to medical school. This kind of knowledge would have been very helpful in deciding my major as well as my courses for freshmen year. 4. Go to Professor's Office Hours They are willing to answer any questions you have, as well as get to know you. They are teaching 200+ students, so knowing a few of them personally would be nice. Also, when you need recommendation letters for grad/medical/pharmacy school, you can always ask them, and many are more than willing to write you one, given that they know you personally. 5. Join Clubs/Organizations While studying is important, it is also important to meet new people and create networks. Like college, grad and professional schools will look beyond the GPA and grades when they are going through applications. They want well-rounded students, who have experience in areas such as leadership and community., 34163=Get the Trojan meal plan when you come as a freshman. It's more expensive, but well worth it., 113653=First and foremost you need to sit down and honestly ask yourself, Why do I want to go to this school? I say this because if you are simply chasing a name or only the social life appeals to you then you are applying for the wrong reasons. Trust me, the admissions team will be able to pick up on this. You need to demonstrate that you are looking to take full advantage of all of the wonderful opportunities available to you at such a reputable university. You need to explain why you would be a great contribution to the Trojan family. What unique abilities or attributes do you have that would benefit the university. The last and most helpful tip that I could possibly give any prospective student is to keep in mind that USC truly values quality over quantity. Please don't feel the need to sign yourself up for every possible extracurricular you can find. A smattering of very different activities on an application only makes it more difficult for an admissions team to figure out who you are. I really hope that these tips can be of value to you guys! And obviously don't take my advice as the be all end all source of information for applying to USC. This is simply my personal opinion. Look around at other reviews and speak to current students or admission counselors. Get a variety of opinions. Good luck, and fight on future trojans! :), 37413=While USC has a fairly high tuition, the overall experience is well worth the money. The education you receive is one of the best in the country and the alumni network is extremely valuable. Being a lifelong member of the Trojan Family is priceless and can connect you to valuable experiences long after you graduate from the university., 556724=Not the safest. Be wary off campus, travel with friends, though that may not even be enough, unfortunately. And don't do anything stupid. Shooting deaths are still outliers, but they happen more frequently. Also, you see helicopters over the region all the time and you always hear sirens it's almost comical. The school is adjacent to a fire station, though. http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/los_angeles&id=8616638 http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/04/usc-shooting-fraternity-row.html http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/shooting-at-usc-halloween-party-leaves-several-wounded.html, 778575=I entered as a freshman for the Fall 2013 semester. I had the average expectations of new college student, and though I might not have finished the first semester with a perfect 4.0, or 10 new best friends, I cannot fathom having gone anywhere else. I love that even in an academically challenging environment, you still feel the SoCal vibe that makes USC so unique., 562376=Average. Even the scholarship winner dorm isn't fantastic - some dorms are sad compared to others, so there is a monumental disparity between dorms. Avoid Marks and Trojan, shoot for Fluor, Webb Tower. Sophomores guaranteed housing but they're off-campus, so a bike is recommended not needed if you get lucky with the housing lottery. Juniors and seniors aren't guaranteed anything so the Dorm Life rating surely goes down. In my opinion off campus housing isn't really great, or is really expensive specifically to the south of USC. Expected more from a top30 school, I guess., 445047=Home to a number of well-rounded and driven students. You will be constantly surrounded by ambition, excellence and school spirit. USC emphasizes it's Trojan family but be sure to find your niche within it., 237889=Be well rounded and enthusiastic! We are all about Trojan Spirit, 692541=USC provides numerous and outstanding opportunities to reach your future goals. The campus is inundated with libraries, research faculties and other resources. As a current Trojan, I have an aspiring amount of dedication and motivation to Fight On! with my life., 541924=USC is a wonderful place full of wonderful people. Not only is it rapidly gaining even more prestige and improving academically, this school offers an endless amount of life-invigorating experiences. In my opinion, USC is especially unique and strong in the way the Trojan family always stays strong in spirit and support, allowing for valuable connections post-graduation., 87657=The spirit is AMAZING. Just being on campus you really get a sense of the Trojan Family., 84151=USC is great for hard working, smart and well rounded students. Trojan students need to be willing to work hard in order to maintain good grades in difficult classes as well as attend the various events around school. USC is a very busy, but fun place to be., 91305=The atmosphere at USC is comforting and lively. Students can freely go about their day never having to worry about not having a good time. The Trojan Family is open, enthusiastic, and entertaining. There is always something to do on campus and outside of campus. The weather here is beautiful, and the clubs/organizations affiliated with USC are inspiring and so much fun., 419734=There aTrore a decent amount of places, but I think there should be more considering the amount of students. I do like Lemonade, CPK and Trojan Grounds., 730469=Really research the school. Ask around to current students and make sure that whatever program you're going into is right for you. It's a lot of money, and if you won't end up benefitting from having the Trojan label attached to your name, I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere., 499434=There are a lot of students who study really hard, for example my roommate, she sometimes stays up late until 4 o'clock., 412310=Work ethic and ambition. Trojan Family. Football., 275022=the trojan knights guard the tommy the trojan statue during homecoming week when there is the annual football game against rival football team ucla. they wrap tommy the trojan in duct tape in order to protect it. the peace sign is the fight on symbol you say to anyone in the family and it signifies being in the trojan family., 640020=Focus on making SATs good. A 1950 is a good base. This way means they're more likely to look at everything., 725454=I'm hoping to be accepted here in Fall 2014. I love the campus and cant wait to experience USC. Go Trojans!, 94744=-Take advantage of the ability to drop classes. USC has a certain period at the beginning of every semester that allows students to drop classes with no penalty if they find it's not quite to their liking. This is a fantastic way to get your feet wet in a certain topic and see if perhaps this course of study is the right one for you. If you find that the material is dull or you don't connect with the subject, you are free to drop the class within a certain period and sign up for a different one. -Go to the football games. USC Football is without a doubt the university's strongest and most uniting force. Gamedays (in the fall) involve Trojan fans from age 9 to 99 tailgating on every square inch of campus. Even if you don't like football (like myself), you will find sheer pride and exuberance bubbling up inside you when you're standing in the student section cheering and singing the USC Fight Song. Gamedays are indescribable and I could not imagine being a Trojan without them. -OFFICE HOURS. The one surefire way to improve your grade is office hours. These are times when students can go to a professor or a TA's office to discuss lecture notes, prepare for an exam, or review an essay. It is the professor and TA's job to be available and accommodating to students, so don't be afraid to email or speak to a professor and arrange for a time when you can meet them. Professors want to get to know their students. If they are able to put your face to a name when grading papers, there is a greater personal connection and your grades will improve. -Start long-term projects the day they are assigned. Even if it's something very small like creating a timeline or an outline, picking out books from the library, or gathering one or two articles, this small step will put you on the right path to finish the project on time. It's very easy to get caught up in the extracurricular side of college and it will make life easier for yourself if you can make little bits of progress instead of doing the entire project the night before. -Take advantage of the Career Services office. They can help you find an on campus job, off campus job or paying internship. In addition to the general career services office, there is usually a special career services department for your school (i.e., engineering, journalism, etc.) -Go to the Student Involvement Fair to find the clubs and groups that best fit your talents and aspirations. From the Judo club to the Triathlon team to the Fashion Industry Association of USC, there is a place for everyone. Don't listen to the stereotype that USC is the University of Spoiled Children and contains only affluent, overprivileged kids. The school is big enough that you will find any type of person you are looking for. I was so happy to have found Troy Camp, the group I am involved in, because it is a group of people who share my passion for summer camp, local kids, and connecting with your inner child. When you find something else to do outside of academia, your university experience will be all the more worthwhile., 76060=I love the atmosphere on campus. It is in a great location near downtown LA as well as the beach and many other fun spots. I love that there is always something go on around campus, so it is never boring! I love the USC Trojan Marching Band because it is just amazing and is a great pick-me when you hear them around campus., 474251=The atmosphere and people around this campus is very friendly. Welcome to the Trojan Family is more than a slogan, you'll feel right at home here at USC! School spirit is as endless as the list of activities you can do in the city of LA., 574467=The week of the UCLA game a group of guys camp out 24/7 at the Tommy Trojan statue., 655594=There are so many opportunities available at USC. From the Trojan Family alumni connections to the internships available, if you put the work in you are guaranteed to find a job for after graduation., 530316=USC students have many traditions. Our motto is Fight On which is used in conversations between students and fans. We have a USC spell out with is said in sporting events. Our school colors are cardinal and gold which translates to the colors we wear to show school spirit. Popular locations on campus are: Tommy Trojan, Traveler, Trousdale parkway, the Coliseum, Ground Zero, and the Bookstore., 835081=Make your stay at USC worthwhile. Connect with other students, join the Greek life or an on-campus organization, and develop mature relationships with professors so you can do well academically. You are a part of the Trojan family so make the best of your college experience at USC., 647305=If you're thinking about applying to USC or if you've gotten in and are seriously considering it, I would highly consider it because of how diverse and connected the alumni system is. The Trojan Family is not a myth, you feel it the second you're admitted and USC continually reminds you that you are always a part of its community. Make sure to visit the campus and get a feel of what it would be like to go to school there. For high schoolers and those looking to go to USC I would recommend taking as many SAT's as possible until you're satisfied with your score. While you're in high school also take the Honors and AP classes, they're worth it. USC loves students who are both smart and stand out amongst the other applicants. Whether this means volunteering, being an entrepreneur, excelling in academics or athletics or simply having an amazing art portfolio, you need something about you that makes you different and passionate., 191999=I love it here! There is a huge sense of being apart of a Trojan Family and you definitely feel it everyday. I can't tell you the countless times my friends and I have run into someone that is connected with USC and felt like I've known that person for years. Being a trojan means your a trojan for life., 420816=This institution has a strong sense of Trojan family pride. It demonstrates this through programs at hiring Trojans after graduation, networking as well as strong support services. USC maintains a high quality reputation and strives to improve every year., 43149=If concerts, speakers, great advisors, a beautiful campus, a global network, lifelong friends, top notch organizations, a variety of majors and minors, and be part of the Trojan Family, then USC is definitely worth ever penny. College is an investment and it all depends on how you go about and use it. If you are only at SC for academics or just one aspect of it then it might not be worth the money. Using SC to its fullest potential will make every dollar of yours worth it. The networking events, to the location, to the friends, to the free activities, to the free stuff, to the limitless resources from the school will make your college experience one to remember and priceless., 448=You can be a college student anywhere for four years, but you'll be a Trojan for life. You will feel the epitome of that atmosphere once you attend orientation. The Trojan Family is not a myth. It is a reality only felt by students, staff, alumni, and the like. It has a fairly large student population, but compared to most public universities, the student teacher ratios are significantly smaller. The benefit of having smaller classes is that you can develop a relationships with your professors in case you need recommendations. USC strives to develop their students individually and you are expected to visit your academic counselors every semester. It truly is an enriching experience. Don't worry about lacking a social life. USC prides itself in its striking diversity and with good reason. With hundreds of clubs and greek communities, you wont have a problem fitting in. FIGHT ON!!!!!!!, 145599=USC is as expensive, if not more, than an Ivy. The Trojan Network does make up for that as it is the strongest that I've heard of. Jobs are almost sealed in that that alumni actively seek undergraduate Trojans in all industries. (And they are incredibly successful in them, too.) If you think about it that you are paying about $40K in tuition for an alumni network, it still kind of gets to you though. Everything at USC still comes with a price, which can really put a burden on your finances. Hopefully that job you get from an alumnus will take care of that., 374148=Attending USC is everything that I expected. The Trojan Spirit and Culture is what I was looking for in a university and I'm so glad to be a part of it. USC has it all, academics, sports, spirit and more., 775832=Wrapping up Tommy Trojan in duck tape before UCLA game, 1536=For prospective freshman, USC isn't just interested in your GPA. There is a heavy emphasis on your image as a versatile individual. Take as many AP classes. Take the SATs until you're exhausted. Be involved in any school activities. Better yet, take advantage of programs and opportunities outside of your high school. For prospective transfers, keep up that GPA, preferably anything above a 3.5. It wouldn't hurt to be involved in your community and/or extracurricular activities. When it's down to two applicants with similar academic standing, extracurriculars are the tie-breaking factors. -------------------------------------------------- Advice to transfers, preferably Santa Monica College Students. Take classes equivalent to USC courses. Refer to: https://camel2.usc.edu/articagrmt/artic.aspx And if you know your intended major, refer to: http://www.usc.edu/admission/undergraduate/private/0910/AdditionalCourseRecommendation09.pdf to give you a competitive edge on your application. (NOTE: some majors require supplemental applications and additional requirements.) Typically, students aspiring to transfer do so within 2 years at a CC. For your first year at community college, if you haven't already chosen a major, focus on getting your GEs out of the way. That way, you can add versatility to your schedule and you'll save about thirty grand in college. Sixty if you transfer for junior standing. NOTE: USC accepts sophomore transfers. However, out of the six GE's you can fulfill at at SMC, two must be completed at USC: diversity and writ140. Study Study Study! There aren't shortcuts in college. Don't expect extra credit assignments despite your prodding and begging. Your school academic counselor is there for reason. More often than not, they can answer questions and offer valuable guidance. APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID ASAP. you will save yourself a lot of grief over the summer to settle any loans and to apply for work-study positions. Be realistic. USC is expensive, but worth every penny. However, if it is beyond your family's income, start saving early. Apply for scholarships. On top of tuition, spare yourself the shock of hidden costs and the disappointment that comes with knowing you cannot finance your dream school's education. Book costs hundreds of dollars especially heavy texts. Even for commuters, health insurance (which you can waive, given the completed requirements) and parking can be pricey. Refer to: http://www.usc.edu/dept/publications/cat2008/tuition/ Sure you can take out as many loans as you want, but depending on the amount, you might be paying it off for life. Good luck to everyone! FIGHT ON!, 185304=I love being here at USC. There is always something to do and the people are great. The trojan spirit is incredible, it is like no other. There is no place like USC., 611874=Very expensive, but with an excellent reputation and far-reaching Trojan Family, it might just be worth it., 28025=USC is known for a lot of things: football, film, expensive, prestigious and snobby by students and non-students. While the last category is debatable, depending on who you meet, USC known for being the University of Stolen Colleagues by the professors from other schools. And for good reason. Granted, there are a couple of bad seeds in the teaching staff, but the good seeds overpower the bad ones. Professors at USC are at the top of their fields, and as part of the Trojan family, they are here to help their students succeed. Many science professors conduct research projects outside of teaching and provide students with opportunities to gain experience for medical school., 552305=USC is expensive, but it is worth it. The Trojan Family is a real thing. The amount internship and job opportunities presented to students by the alumni are unlike is other college. The education here is one of the best you could get. And you'll no doubt have a fun time., 44128=I cannot be any happier than I am at USC. From the second I visited the campus to the day I moved my excitement for being a Trojan has just kept growing. USC not only offers many opportunities for student life, organizations, athletics, Greek life and many other, it is also located in the heart of Los Angeles where all the entertainment, different food venues such as the many cultural towns, museums, malls, and many more famous locations. There is a reason why people have so much Trojan pride and emphasize the Trojan family very often, itâs because once you step on campus you get a sense of belonging, a relaxing and comforting feel from all the students, staff, and faculty. It is awesome and nothing compares to student life at SC. One day there will be renowned speakers from the industry speaking about career advice, or another day early movie screenings at Norris with directors, or a another day a concert on McCarthy, a Saturday at a Trojan football game, long nights at Leavey library studying for finals, fun with friends, or doing community service in LA and for USC. The average day of a Trojan is different in so many ways and that is what makes being a Trojan enjoyable, the many combination to live your own college experience and the opportunities and freedom to make your own college career an unforgettable one., 38045=I love being a part of the Trojan Family! Looking back on my freshman year, one of the most enjoyable things about USC are the football games. The entire campus is covered with energetic and dedicated fans from early morning until late at night. The school spirit here is incredible and makes the entire community feel more like a family of football lovers than complete strangers. In addition to football, there are many events, like free concerts or club fund raisers, going on around campus that there is hardly a dull moment. But all of the hustle and bustle is not the only thing that makes USC such a fantastic school. The student body is so diverse that it is impossible not to find a core group of friends that share your common interests. And if youâre looking to step away from the college scene for a few hours, LA and itâs surrounding neighborhoods offer plenty of entertainment for a night on the town!, 524171=Is a great university with a lot of school pride. The Trojan Network is definitely something to look into and is key to helping you getting a job in the future. The faculty are always willing to help you attain what you want for your future., 303945=USC is a great school in terms of social life as well as academics. The trojan network is an amazing way to pursue your career. It is very easy to get involved., 207786=Students who are very school spirited and like to be involved will greatly appreciate this atmosphere. Although the school is huge, students, professors, and alumni really come together and create what is known as the Trojan Family., 869606=Â© 2015, Cappex.com, LLC, 350205=The Greek life at USC is an instrumental part of the social scene and Greeks play a large role in leadership on campus, and have a reputation for being involved in multiple organizations. The different chapters at USC come together and are involved in community service and employ a great deal of Trojan spirit by taking time out of their day to help the Los Angeles community. Many chapters at USC have raised thousands of dollars through the years for various organizations and hospitals in the Los Angeles area and the Greek life at USC continues to establish a great connection with its community. Also, fraternities and sororities play in intramural events on campus, including the Iron Man and the Helen of Troy. These events allow different fraternities and sororities to come together and play in different sports, which are administered by the recreation department.}",,"06/06/2009 Reviewer is Accepted here and planning to attend soon.

Make the most of all the opportunities because they really make an application competitive! Take lots of AP classes and work hard to keep up your grades. APs also help out to save you credits (and money!) in college if you do well enough on the exams. Participate in lots of activities: go out for a sports team, yearbook, student government, etc... anything and EVERYTHING looks good. Volunteer as much as possible - even if it's just minor things, they add a lot to applications. Leadership is also really important; try for something in student government, captain a sports team, lead a club (or even start your own!). Colleges look for applicants that take initiative and become self-starters. When applying to college, pay attention to DEADLINES. They're important. It's an expensive school, so try applying for scholarships and financial aid. I would definitely say it's worth the money though. Other than that, enjoy high school but study, study, study. Once you get into the school of your dreams, it's worth it.

We are also proposing to remove references to CWC prices from the renewable fuel standard regulations, and instead intend to post the prices on EPA's Web site. This proposed rule also indicates what the CWC prices for 2014 and 2015 would be using the data sources and methodology contained in the rule; however these prices will not be established until they are posted on our Web site following the effective date of the rule. In addition, we are proposing minor amendments to the renewable fuel standard program regulations to reinsert sections inadvertently overwritten by the Quality Assurance Program final rule published on July 18, 2014. In the âRules and Regulationsâ? section of this Federal Register, we are making these same amendments as a direct final rule. If we receive no adverse comment, the direct final rule will go into effect and we will not take further action on this proposed rule., 135669=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to extend the Clean Air Act's (CAA) prohibition against the sale of conventional gasoline in reformulated gasoline (RFG) areas to the southern Maine counties of York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Knox, and Lincoln. This proposal is based on a request from the Governor of the State of Maine for areas within the ozone transport region established under the CAA. The CAA does not give the EPA discretion to deny a Governor's request on this matter. The scope of the EPA's discretion is limited to establishing the date that the prohibition commences. Consistent with the Governor's request, the EPA proposes that this prohibition commence on May 1, 2015 for all refiners, importers, and distributors in the Maine counties referenced in the Governor's request, and on June 1, 2015 for all retailers and wholesale purchaser-consumers in those counties. The EPA is also adding in its RFG opt-out rules a provision to reflect that there is a four-year minimum opt-in period for areas that opt into the RFG program on the basis of their location within the ozone transport region. This clarification will align the federal regulation for RFG opt-out requirements with the CAA., 58133=Title 40 published on 2014-07-01, 72084=Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to set renewable fuel percentage standards every year. This action proposes annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel that apply to all motor vehicle gasoline and diesel produced or imported in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The EPA is establishing a cellulosic biofuel volume for all three years that is below the applicable volume specified in the Act, and is also proposing to rescind the cellulosic biofuel standard for 2011. Relying on statutory waiver authorities, the EPA is proposing to adjust the applicable volumes of advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel for all three years. The 2015 and 2016 proposed standards are expected to spur further progress in overcoming current constraints in renewable fuel distribution infrastructure, which in turn is expected to lead to substantial growth over time in the production and use of higher-level ethanol blends and other qualifying renewable fuels. In this action, we are also proposing the applicable volume of biomass-based diesel for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. Finally, we are proposing compliance and attest reporting deadlines for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015, as well as proposing regulatory amendments to clarify the scope of the existing algal biofuel pathway., 34899=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is extending the Clean Air Act's (CAA) prohibition against the sale of conventional gasoline in reformulated gasoline (RFG) areas to the southern Maine counties of York, Cumberland, Sagadahoc, Androscoggin, Kennebec, Knox, and Lincoln (hereinafter, the âSouthern Maine Countiesâ?).

The CAA does not give the EPA discretion to deny a Governor's request on this matter. The scope of the EPA's discretion is limited to establishing the date that the prohibition commences. Consistent with the Governor's request, the EPA is finalizing as proposed a prohibition commencement date of May 1, 2015 for all refiners, importers, and distributors in the Maine counties referenced in the Governor's request, and June 1, 2015 for all retailers and wholesale purchaser- consumers in those counties. The EPA is also adding in its RFG opt-out rules a provision to reflect that there is a four-year minimum opt-in period for areas that opt into the RFG program on the basis of their location within the ozone transport region. This clarification aligns the federal regulation for RFG opt-out requirements with the CAA., 13031=Because EPA received adverse comment on certain elements of the Tier 3 Amendments direct final rule published on February 19, 2015, we are withdrawing those elements of the direct final rule. EPA intends to consider the comments received and proceed with a new final rule for the withdrawn elements. The remaining elements will go into effect pursuant to the direct final rule., 78199=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing a public hearing to be held in Kansas City, Kansas on June 25, 2015 for the proposed rule âRenewable Fuel Standard Program: Standards for 2014, 2015, and 2016 and Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2017.â? This proposed rule will be published separately in the Federal Register . The pre-publication version of this proposal can be found at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels/renewablefuels/regulations.htm. In the separate notice of proposed rulemaking, EPA has proposed amendments to the renewable fuel standard program regulations that would establish annual percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, and renewable fuels that would apply to all gasoline and diesel produced in the U.S. or imported in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. In addition, the separate proposal includes a proposed biomass-based diesel applicable volume for 2017., 130538=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing that it will not be finalizing 2014 applicable percentage standards under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program before the end of 2014. In light of this delay in issuing the 2014 RFS standards, the compliance demonstration deadline for the 2013 RFS standards will take place in 2015. EPA will be making modifications to the EPA-Moderated Transaction System (EMTS) to ensure that Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) generated in 2012 are valid for demonstrating compliance with the 2013 applicable standards., 23548=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to clarify our regulations related to the data sources used to establish the cellulosic waiver credit (CWC) price. We are also removing references to CWC prices from the renewable fuel standard regulations, and instead intend to post the prices on EPA's Web site. The direct final rule also indicates what the CWC prices for 2014 and 2015 would be using the data sources and methodology contained in the rule; however these prices will not be established until they are posted on our Web site following the effective date of the rule. In addition, we are making minor amendments to the renewable fuel standard program regulations to reinsert sections inadvertently overwritten by the Quality Assurance Program final rule published on July 18, 2014., 3387=Due to the receipt of two adverse comments, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is withdrawing the May 7, 2015 direct final rule to approve the request from Alabama to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 of each year in Jefferson and Shelby counties, Alabama (âthe Birmingham areaâ?). The EPA is considering these comments and will address the comments in a separate action. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action., 146599=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to extend two reporting deadlines for the 2013 compliance period under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. This proposed action would specifically affect the annual compliance and attest engagement reporting requirement deadlines for regulated parties. The annual compliance reports and attest engagement reports for the 2013 RFS compliance period would not be due until 30 days and 90 days, respectively, following publication of the final rule establishing the 2014 renewable fuel percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel in the Federal Register . This proposed action would ensure timely amendment of existing deadlines, before compliance obligations would otherwise go into effect. In the âRules and Regulationsâ? section of this Federal Register , we are extending the annual compliance and attest engagement reporting deadlines for the 2013 RFS compliance period as a direct final rule without a prior proposed rule. If we receive no adverse comment, we will not take further action on this proposed rule., 49695=Under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, producers and importers of renewable fuel generate Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) that are used by petroleum refiners and importers to demonstrate compliance with their renewable fuel volume obligations. Several cases of fraudulently generated RINs, however, led to inefficiencies and a significant reduction in the overall liquidity in the RIN market, resulting in greater difficulty for smaller renewable fuel producers to sell their RINs. Today's action finalizes additional regulatory provisions that are intended to assure reasonable oversight of RIN generation and promote greater liquidity in the RIN market, which in turn helps ensure the use of the required renewable fuel volumes. The rule includes a voluntary quality assurance program and related provisions intended to meet these goals. The program also includes elements designed to make it possible to verify the validity of RINs from the beginning of 2013. Additionally, we are finalizing a number of new regulatory provisions to ensure that RINs are retired for all renewable fuel that is exported and to address RINs that become invalid downstream of a renewable fuel producer., 44415=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to extend two reporting deadlines for the 2013 compliance period under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. This action specifically affects the annual compliance and attest engagement reporting requirement deadlines for regulated parties. The annual compliance reports and attest engagement reports for the 2013 RFS compliance period will not be due until 30 days and 90 days, respectively, following publication of the final rule establishing the 2014 renewable fuel percentage standards for cellulosic biofuel, biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel and total renewable fuel in the Federal Register . This action ensures timely amendment of existing deadlines, before compliance obligations would otherwise go into effect., 7854=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking final action to approve a request from the state of Alabama for the EPA to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 of each year for Jefferson and Shelby counties (âthe Birmingham areaâ?). Specifically, the EPA is approving amendments to the regulations to change the RVP standard for the Birmingham area from 7.8 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.0 psi for gasoline. The EPA has determined that this change to the federal RVP regulation is consistent with the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Additionally, the EPA is responding to adverse comments received for this action., 18006=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is taking direct final action to approve a request from the state of Alabama for the EPA to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 of each year for Jefferson and Shelby counties (âthe Birmingham areaâ?). Specifically, the EPA is approving amendments to the regulations to change the RVP standard for the Birmingham area from 7.8 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.0 psi for gasoline. The EPA has determined that this change to the federal RVP regulation is consistent with the applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act (CAA). This action is being taken without prior proposal because the EPA believes that this rulemaking is noncontroversial for the reasons set forth in this preamble, and due to the limited scope of this action., 93540=The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to approve a request from the state of Alabama for the EPA to relax the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) standard applicable to gasoline introduced into commerce from June 1 to September 15 of each year for Jefferson and Shelby counties (âthe Birmingham areaâ?). Specifically, the EPA is proposing to amend the regulations to change the RVP standard for the Birmingham area from 7.8 pounds per square inch (psi) to 9.0 psi for gasoline.

De uitbreiding van het stemrecht heeft ze ons doen aanvaarden sedert 1893. Zij zijn in verband met noodwendigheden zo dringend, zo evident van het vergroot kiezerskorps dat zij zich aan alle politieke partijen opdringen. Een hele wetgeving,[1] met een klimmend interventionisme, is er door afgeleid en zelfs in de conservatieve rangen zijn diegenen talrijk die ze trachten uit te breiden en te ontwikkelen., 58773=Deze wet is niet hoegenaamd uitsluitend en zij houdt rekening met alle mogelijke overgangsmaatregelen. Zij is de bijna woordelijke vertaling van een voorstel dat ingediend werd in de Franse Kamer, op 20 maart 1900, dat door haar reeds gestemd werd op 5 maart 1902 en dat wet geworden is op 29 juli 1905.[7], 68200=Het was wel onder de indruk van dit verslag dat de hogere Raad op 20 maart 1907, en dat nog wel met algemene stemmen, verklaarde dat de wettelijke beperking der werkuren van volwassen arbeiders een zeer nadelige en schadelijke maatregel zou wezen, zowel voor de werklieden als voor de nijveraars., 45228=In naam der socialistische groep heb ik de eer gehad het wetsvoorstel op de wekelijkse rustdag neder te leggen. M. Helleputte heeft mijn voorbeeld gevolgd, van zijn voorstel van 1895 enige schikkingen afscheidend., 16581=M. Van Cauwenbergh legde het verslag neer, gunstig, in de zitting van 23 januari 1896. Men mag dus zeggen dat hij de neigingen weergaf waarmee de meerderheid bepaald tevreden was., 19247=Art. 1. â Aan de tegenwoordige wet zijn onderworpen de nijverheden opgenoemd in artikel Ã©Ã©n der wet van 13 december 1889 aangaande de vrouwen, jongelingen en kinderarbeid in de nijverheidsgestichten, 47537=De uitbuiting der mijnen, onder de verschillende nijverheden van ons land, heeft ten eerste een bijzonder karakter. De grond, in waarde gebracht, toegestaan aan de kapitalisten, is een nationale eigendom die zonder twijfel toegestaan is, maar waarop de natie niet van al haar rechten heeft afgezien. De artikelen 47 tot 50 van de wet van 21 april 1810 zijn onder meer een voorbeeld dat men zou kunnen aanhalen.[6] Het is hetgeen sedert lang gewettigd en vergemakkelijkt een bijzondere regeling toegelaten heeft van deze nijverheid, die aan het bestendig toezicht onderworpen is van een ganse reeks ambtenaren., 35639=Men kan nog een stelling aanhalen, voorgelegd aan de geneeskundige faculteit van Lyon in juli 1900, door dokter J. Sachnine: Etude sur lâinfluence de la durÃ©e du travail quotidien sur la santÃ© gÃ©nÃ©rale de lâadulte. Wij zullen er enkel de besluiten van aanhalen:, 2670=Heden, 1 mei 1907, terwijl aan de Volkshuizen de rode vlaggen in de wind wapperen, en het rumoer van stoeten en betogingen in de verte uitsterft, werk ik. Ik werk voor de anderen. Voor u, vrienden arbeiders, voor wie het heden feest is, feest waardoor gij uw fiere vreugd uitdrukt te arbeiden, terzelfder tijd uw onwrikbare wil te kennen geeft u geen bovenmatige arbeid te laten opleggen. Ik werk om u wapens te leveren om uw strijd voort te zetten. Germinal heeft mij gevraagd de verschillende documenten, in verband met de wettelijke regeling van de arbeidsdag, in een brochure te willen samenvatten. Tot waar zijn wij ten huidige dage gekomen, van wetgevend standpunt gezien? Ik zal trachten het te zeggen. Men zal zien dat, niettegenstaande de onvermijdelijke traagheid van iedere ernstige hervorming, de volbrachte feiten van aard zijn ons aan te moedigen. Men zal vaststellen niettegenstaande de openlijke of bedekte tegenstand, de hervorming aan het rijpen is en men haar toekomstige overwinning mag verhopen. Het komt er op aan de krachten te verdubbelen om de uitslag te behalen; het komt er ook op aan, ook terwijl men het krachtigste beroep doet op de tussenkomst van de wetgever, nooit te vergeten dat de wet maar breder en toegepast wordt volgens âs werkers belang, zo de werkende klasse, bewust van dit belang, van haar plicht en van haar recht, verstandig, genoeg georganiseerd, oplettend genoeg is om zelf op de bevestiging van haar overwinningen te waken. De wetgevende werking is niets zo zij niet gesteund is op de syndicale beweging, op de rechtstreekse werking der arbeiders. De bevrijding der arbeiders kan bevordert worden door het bewind, maar in laatste aanleg zal zij het werk der arbeiders zelf zijn. J.D. mei 1907, 72094=_______________ [1] Zie bijvoorbeeld Code du Travail, door Max Hallet en Jules DestrÃ©e, Brussel, H. Lamartin, uitgever.

M. Janson, de man met het goed hart en de helderziende geest, die de werkliedendemocratie met eerbied groet, had het wel begrepen toen hij 17 januari 1890 een wetsvoorstel neerlegde, de normale arbeidsdag in de mijnen verminderend. Hij ontwikkelde er krachtig de redenen van. Maar zijn grootmoedige stem ging verloren in de onverschilligheid van de cijnskamer, de middenafdeling verwierp het bij eenparigheid, na een verslag van M. Sabatier (30 juli 1891). De tijd was nog niet gekomen, het algemeen maken van het stemrecht was nodig voor het mogelijk maken van hetgeen hij wenste. De zaak is rijp, riep hij dan uit. Hoeveel meer is zij het nu niet? Hoezeer is zij het niet sedert dat vreemden op die weg hebben gezien? Wij herhalen met Paul Janson: âWaarom zouden wij aarzelen het enig kapitaal van de mijnwerker, zijn krachten en zijn gezondheid, te beschermen?â?, 42100=In 1859 verkondigde M. dâElhougne, welsprekend, hier zelf: âDe meester houdt de arbeider in zijn hand geplooid door de dubbele dwingelandij van het loonstelsel en de behoeften.â?, 51579=Amendementen der heren Beernaert en Helleputte, van mijn vrienden Denis en Vandervelde beantwoordden, in 1907, aan de wensen van M. Paul Janson en gaven aanleiding tot een lange bespreking. Mijn vrienden Mansart en Maroille kwamen tussen om krachtige, merkwaardige redevoeringen uit te spreken., 65704=Art. 5. â Het bedrag der reis en verblijfkosten van de leden van deze commissie worden bepaald volgens ons besluit van 23 januari 1898, maar gewijzigd door dit van 8 juni 1899, betreffend de commissies die aangesteld worden door het algemeen bestuur van de Mijnraad., 58482=Deze wet, die zal toegepast worden voor al de mijnwerkers van het land, hebben wij voorgesteld in de Kamer, zij is ondertekend door al de afgevaardigden der mijnwerkers, volgens de besluiten die genomen werden door hun landelijk congres, gehouden te Charleroi, op 7 september 1902., 22138=Art. 7. â De artikelen 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 en 19 der wet van 13 december 1889 zijn toepasselijk aan deze wet., 56525=Het aannemen van het zÃ³ nietig, zo ontwijkend amendement Beernaert, dat van een zÃ³ verafgelegen toepassing moet zijn, was voldoende om de val van het kabinet De Smet te veroorzaken, dat op 11 april zijn ontslag gaf., 29432=De zaak kan van drie standpunten beschouwd worden: economisch, gezondheid en zedelijk. Het is vooral op het eerste dat John Rae zich heeft geplaatst in zijn boek De Achturendag (theorie en studie vergeleken met zijn toepassingen en hun economische en maatschappelijke uitslagen.[2] Een Franse vertaling van dit uitstekend werk is verschenen bij Giard & BriÃ¨re te Parijs, in 1900. Niet zonder zekere verwondering heb ik kunnen vaststellen dat dit boek, onontbeerlijk voor de studie der zaak, verstaanbaar voor al onze propagandisten, onbekend was hij het merendeel van onze parlementsleden. Men heeft anderen gehoord van de liberale afgevaardigden, en niet van de minsten, met rondborstigheid bekennen, dat zij de zaak niet kenden en zich bereid verklaarden ze te onderzoeken. Zo zeer het waar is dat in deze economische zaken, waarin het onpartijdig onderzoek der feiten de methode bij voorkeur zou moeten zijn, stelt men zich in het algemeen tevreden met indrukken zonder reden, theoretische afleidingen en oppervlakkige beschouwingen!, 66255=Gegeven te Passable, op 6 april 1907. LEOPOLD., 26383=Art. 12. â Het van kracht worden van deze wet is bepaald op 1 januari 1902., 34696=Op gezondheidspunt heeft de zaak het onderwerp uitgemaakt van zorgvuldige opzoekingen en aanzienlijke werken. Uitstekende geneesheren hebben de besluiten van de economisten bevestigd. Het Internationaal Congres van Gezondheidsleer en Volkenkunde, gehouden in 1894 te Boedapest, âde weldoende besluiten beschouwend die zich overal geopenbaard hebben voor de arbeidsdag en de hinderlijkheid van het nachtwerk op gezondheidspuntâ?, sprak zich in principe uit voor de achturenarbeidsdag en de afschaffing van de nachtarbeid en vroeg aan de wetgeving van alle landen van de huidige beschaving stap voor stap naar de instelling van de achturendag te gaan. De zaak werd opnieuw onderzocht te Parijs in 1900 en, na een merkwaardig verslag van E. Vaillant,[4] Kamerlid voor Parijs, bevestigde het Xe Internationaal Congres van Gezondheidsleer en Volkenkunde de dagorde van het congres van Boedapest., 41147=De toepassing van het princiep der regeling van de arbeid moet tot de volwassenen uitgebreid worden. Alle Europese natiÃ«n hebben de beperking van de arbeidsdag voor vrouwen en kinderen aangenomen. Deze eerste hervorming is geen gemakkelijke overwinning geweest. De weerstand was hevig en aanhoudend, en in 1889, wanneer de wet hier gestemd werd, waren er talrijke besprekingen nodig om tot die uitslag te komen., 24509=Art. 8. â Voor de andere nijverheidstakken kunnen nochtans vrijstellingen worden verleend in de vorm bepaald bij artikel 7 van de wet van 13 december 1889, doch voor de duur van slechts Ã©Ã©n maand., 45820=Zo de wet de halve arbeidsdag op vijf uren heeft vastgesteld, volgt daaruit dat de maximumarbeidsdag logisch tien uren moet zijn. De stemming der wet van 1905, niettegenstaande de verzwakkingen, voorbehoud en ingewikkeldheid die er de uitlegging en de toepassing zo moeilijk van maken, behoudt dus, van principieel standpunt gezien, een aanzienlijke belangrijkheid. Hetgeen uitlegt dat sommige liberalen, en ook M. de Smet de Nayer, het nodig achtten zich te onthouden., 6158=De taal die de heer Helleputte voerde, een van de leiders van de katholieke partij, heden minister van de spoorwegen, in zijn uiteenzetting van de beweegredenen van zijn voorstel van 12 februari 1895, is onder dit opzicht, zo karakteristiek als beslissend:}","Wed, 13 May 2015 22:17:41 GMT","De federatie der Mijnwerkersbonden heeft dan ook onmiddellijk geantwoord met het inrichten van een raadpleging der werklieden in het algemeen. Ziehier de uitslag van dit referendum: In de loop der bespreking van de amendementen Beernaert-Helleputte heeft de minister van Arbeid verklaard dat de mijnwerkers onverschillig bleven aan het vraagstuk. Daardoor bewees hij, op een onvergeeflijke wijze, dat hij niet eens wist dat het sedert meer dan tien jaar aan de dagorde staat van alle congressen. De algemeenheid in het stemmen vermindert aanzienlijk de waarde van dit oordeel in plaats van ze te verhogen. Zij bewijst immers dat de hervorming afgewezen is door de Raad, zonder ernstig te zijn besproken, zonder dat men de aanhangers ervan gehoord heeft. Men heeft alleen de zienswijze vernomen van de kapitalistische wereld en het is de moeite waard om hier weer eens de klassengeest vast te stellen, het klassebelang, waardoor de meeste werkgevers vreemd worden aan alle vooruitgang, aan alle ontwikkeling en verbreiding van het algemeen geweten. Het was wel onder de indruk van dit verslag dat de hogere Raad op 20 maart 1907, en dat nog wel met algemene stemmen, verklaarde dat de wettelijke beperking der werkuren van volwassen arbeiders een zeer nadelige en schadelijke maatregel zou wezen, zowel voor de werklieden als voor de nijveraars. Met bijzondere aandacht moeten allen het merkwaardig verslag lezen van M. De Smet de Naeyer (een verwant van de gewezen minister) die met kracht alle argumenten verzamelt die door de nijveraars worden gebruikt tegen de vermindering der werkuren.","En het landelijk congres der Mijnwerkers, gehouden te Auvelais, op 21 april 1907, stemde een dagorde, eisend de bespreking van het wetsvoorstel DestrÃ©e, zodra de kamerzittingen hernomen werden of, zo er aan die eis niet werd voldaan, een landelijk referendum over de algemene werkstaking op 15 november 1907! De ongeduldige eisen der belanghebbende werkers, de voorstellen der socialistische kamergroep, de werkingen der aangestelde onderzoekscommissie, de stemmingen in het Parlement en zelfs de laatste ministeriÃ«le crisis dragen er dus dringend toe bij om deze hervorming in al haar betekenis als een gewichtig vraagstuk voor het hele land op te werpen. Men zal er nu niet meer aan ontsnappen! Uitvluchten, ontwijkingen, heen en weer praten noch krachtdadig verzet zullen tevergeefs, nutteloos zijn. Men zal het vraagstuk moeten oplossen. Niemand, hoe behendig en machtig hij ook weze, zal zich in deze nog ongestraft op de weg der democratie stellen. De koning zelf zal zich moeten onderwerpen! Hij zal zich moeten onderwerpen of... er uit trekken, wat nog een oplossing ware waartegen wij ons geenszins zouden verzetten! _______________ [1] Zie bijvoorbeeld Code du Travail, door Max Hallet en Jules DestrÃ©e, Brussel, H. Lamartin, uitgever. Het zal voldoende zijn de inhoud in te zien om te bevestigen dat de arbeidswetten zich vermenigvuldigd hebben sedert 1886 en vooral sedert 1893.

This table defines which vertex index (using one-based indices) is the provoking vertex for a particular primitive type. The iâ represents the one-based index of the primitive being drawn. For example, if you draw GL_TRIANGLE_FANS with 5 vertices, iâ will range over [1, 3]. Thus, when using last vertex conventions, the provoking vertex of primitive index 2 will be the vertex index 4. void glProvokingVertexâ(GLenum provokeModeâ); Each primitive type defines which index in the vertex stream defines the provoking vertex for a particular output primitive. There is a way to change the provoking vertex convention (primarily for D3D Compatibility):  One of the vertices in an output primitive is designated the ""provoking vertex"". This vertex has special meanings for the primitive. For example, when using flat-shading on output variables, only outputs from the provoking vertex are used; every fragment generated by that primitive gets it's input from the output of the provoking vertex.  Provoking vertex As with other primitive types that take multiple values from the stream, incomplete patches are ignored. So if you render with a number of vertices not divisible by vâ, then those last vertices are ignored.  The number of vertices per patch is defined by calling glPatchParameteriâ with","Patches do not have a provoking vertex, since GL_PATCH can only be used with Tessellation. And by the time tessellation is finished, the primitive isn't a GL_PATCH anymore. The output primitive of tessellation does have a provoking vertex. Primitive restart Main article: Vertex Rendering#Primitive Restart Setting a primitive restart index will cause the interpretation of the primitive to be reset when that index is reached in the vertex stream. The vertex data at that index will not be processed, nor will a vertex be inserted into the vertex stream for that index value.
