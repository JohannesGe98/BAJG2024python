Between clubs, sports (including intramurals!), events (even dances like the President's Ball!), and a really nice rec-center, there is absolutely no excuse not to get involved. Use the free transportation! GV is really green and offers bus transportation to almost anywhere you could possibly need. Take advantage of campus dining! It's not scary dorm food, it actually is delicious... which is more reason to take advantage of the rec-center to battle the freshman 15. Finally, I felt extremely safe and comfortable on this campus, and that doesn't happen easily. I could not have imagined a better freshman experience and highly recommend this school! Bang for the buck Grand Valley helps the majority of students financially, which definitely helped make my decision to go here easier. Am enjoying being here",True,0,0,,

I actually think our campus is rated something like 6th safest campus in the country. Not only because of the campus safety, but also because the school's out in the middle of nowhere. But campus safety is always there to help. If you don't feel safe walking home, you can just call campus safety and they'll get someone to walk with you. There's also street lights on all the time."", ""I've been to a couple of clubs, but our school has a club for literally EVERYTHING. Comic book club, lumberjack club, greek classic's club, ALL KINDS OF STUFF! It's amazing the diversity of it all! There's also some athletic clubs like Lacrosse and several intramural sports."", ""Great for commuter students of the west michigan area, students that want to get to know several different types of students, and people who want a learning experience where there's more one on one with the professors."", ""Well, there's this place on one of the walk ways on campus where there's a giant blue statue that's shaped like a house being re/deconstructed depending which way you walk underneath it. Legend has it, if you walk under it the deconstructing' way, you'll fail everything in college ever and your exam scores will be terrible."", ""As far as school's like this go, it's pretty reasonably priced. The teachers are great and are always there to help you as much as they possibly can. And as far as the I know, the Art, Education, Nursing, and engineering programs are supposed to be really good here."", ""There's always some kind of campus event going on. Whether it be quidditch tournaments or a kickball competition. Also, there's also downtown grand rapids. All students at GVSU get to ride the local bus, The Rapid, for free! The bus ride downtown from campus is about 15-20 minutes. Totally worth it, though. there's ton to do and explore down there! Including Art Prize in the fall and laugh fest in the spring. there's also free concerts during new year's, swing dancing on tuesday nights at Rosa Park's circle, and also a lot of cute little shops! I've found that it's also a lot of fun to explore the ravines and woods behind campus, too. There's all kinds of trails back there! A great place to explore with some friends!"", ""The food is pretty great. The only thing is, the cafeteria the most close to the freshman dorms is the one, of course, with all the bad food for you. The one with the healthier food is a little farther away. So make that trip! It's worth it! I gained at least 20 pounds my first year because i didn't feel like walking to the healthier cafeteria. Don't do that to yourself!"", ""Dorm life is really great! The RA's do an excellent job of trying to get a sense of community. Planning different events and parties for students to participate in. And in my experience, they've also been good at reacting calmly and rationally during any sort of emergency. As for the dorms themselves, they're all really well kept! Even some of the older ones. And there's always a cafeteria a reasonable walking distance away. No matter where you are on campus. The only negative thing is that the freshman dorms are kind of far away from the art buildings and some of the writing buildings. It's only really close to the science buildings and the gen ed building. Which was kind of hard during the winter months around here. Because of the lake effect snow, we can sometimes get 1-2 feet of snow out here overnight, which makes it hard to well, want to go to classes. Especially if you have to walk a distance."", ""I found myself being challenged at a good rate here! I'm an illustration major, though. So the classes I take aren't necessarily hard because you have to be smart or study a lot. They're hard because you have to put a lot of your time into assignments. On my art classes, I spend, oh I don't know, somewhere between 10-20 hours per class outside of class on projects. It's all about being hard working and keeping up. I found that was the same instance with my gen ed courses as well."", ""My tip would be to never EVER procrastinate. I got into a lot of troubles my freshman year and ended up extremely stressed because I would leave projects to the last minute. Don't do that to yourself! Start the day you receive an assignment and, as hard as it is, try to make school your number one priority. It will pay off in the end."", ""Grand Valley has a beautiful campus.

I am absolutely never worried when I am walking by my self and I know that the rules that they have are placed for my safety and that of others. The Campus police are fantastic at their jobs and if you need help they are just a phone call away. Everyone is given the number to get ahold of them. So there is no question of your safety here.', 'Greek Life at Grand Valley is nothing too chaotic and is very helpful of the programs that they support. Greek life at GV is always hosting different group projects and doing things to make their different fraternities and sororities known. Becoming apart of one of the groups of the Greek Life at Grand Valley is a good way to become close with a group of people that you will probably make friends with for life.', 'There are countless clubs and activities that you can join all the time at Grand Valley and there is something for virtually everyone and anyone.

Where the first year students are put into groups and are taken on tours of the campus and different assembly's and group activities that make them more comfortable with the campus and making friends. It is a great experience and it is of course optional but I would not miss out on this."", 'I would say that Grand Valley is definitely worth the money you pay. This campus is one that you will instantly love and the people are so nice. The curriculum is challenging but also worth the effort and is different and fun.You will not be disappointed if you choose Grand Valley. The various majors and minors to chose from and the classes that go along with them are wonderful and usually fit anything you could possibly want or need to take.', 'For fun there are multiple groups that you can join for free and just try out for a day if you want. Being involved at Grand Valley is not a hard thing to do as it is such a friendly place and there is always something going on to give you some time for fun and relaxation from studying.', 'The food and places to eat at are really good. It is definitely better than the cafeteria food that we all become accustomed to in high school and you have a better choice of variety in the different types of food. Also, the places that you can eat at do things to accommodate those who do not eat meat. It is a great experience.', ""Dorm life is so fun and you are able to make so many friends. I would suggest a dorm to anyone new coming to Grand Valley as it is an experience that you will not soon forget and you are able to make so many connections. Make sure that you don't miss out on this wonderful opportunity. Yes, the dorms may be small but it is absolutely worth it."", 'The work load and the amount of time you need for studying is much different than that of your regular high school work.

In our freshman dorm they also told us to leave the door open as much as possible, and people would just walk around from room to room to say hello. They also had seminars for freshman that were all about making friends and adjusting to college. For older students, there are also lots of parties to go to at off-campus apartments, but the actual campus is a dry campus.

Many of my female friends have expressed that they are never worried about walking around the campus alone. I have never had any feeling that I was in any danger even the many instances where I was walking home from the library after midnight.', 'Personally, I did not partake in Greek life; however, a number of my friends did. They have all had positive reviews and have told me they do not regret the decision to go Greek. The only downside I found to Greek life is that it is quite expensive.', 'Grand Valley has over three hundred various clubs that are available for students. There is also an extensive intramural sports program that allows students to continue playing the sports they love at a very low cost.', 'A great university for very active students who came from a small school. Also for students who enjoy smaller class sizes and more individual attention for professors. I must also include that you have to love the snow as well, because we get a great deal of lake-effect snow.', ""On Grand Valley's campus there is a giant blue arch that almost nobody ever walks under because the legend is that if you walk under the arch you will fail your next final. I never decided to challenge that legend."", 'Grand Valley is one of the least expensive state universities in Michigan. That being said, they have a very competitive application process and many well-respected programs. My family has definitely appreciated how economical it was to attend Grand Valley and receive a quality education at a fair price.', ""Throughout the year there are many campus-sponsored events that go on to help students get to know each other and have fun. There is also a state-of-the-art rec center for any avid weightlifters, basketball players, volleyball players, or swimmers. Anyone who is active will never be out of activities on Grand Valley's campus."", 'In Michigan, Grand Valley is known for having some of the best food on a college campus. There are three main cafeterias and one of them is all-you-can-eat, always with fresh fruit and many options. There is never any reason a freshman wont have a good meal at Grand Valley.', 'Dorm life at Grand Valley was an experience I will never forget. Everyone in my building was very friendly and always had their doors open or unlocked to welcome people in. The facilities are all almost brand new, which makes the living arrangements quite spacious and feel more like a home than a dorm room.', 'Grand Valley will challenge students in a way that they never experienced in high school. Thankfully, as a freshman you can ease into the rigorous college courses by taking more general-education classes your first semester. After that, typically students are more ready to handle advanced courses that directly pertain to their individual majors.', 'As a freshman everything will be new and seem a little overwhelming at first. I would recommend attending all of the campus-sponsored events that you can the first few weeks because that is where you can meet a lot of new friends.

Between clubs, sports (including intramurals!), events (even dances like the President's Ball!), and a really nice rec-center, there is absolutely no excuse not to get involved. Use the free transportation! GV is really green and offers bus transportation to almost anywhere you could possibly need. Take advantage of campus dining! It's not scary dorm food, it actually is delicious... which is more reason to take advantage of the rec-center to battle the freshman 15. Finally, I felt extremely safe and comfortable on this campus, and that doesn't happen easily. I could not have imagined a better freshman experience and highly recommend this school!

When I auditioned the students and professors were so welcoming. After my audition I was able to talk to Shaun Bible, one of the instructors, and he made everyone at the audition feel good about themselves from what he said. I find this so important because he did not come off as intimidating, and with instructors who love what their doing, and treat people with immense friendliness, it leads to a successful program. Concluding, with such friendly and welcoming people, I am sure the clubs and activities at Grand Valley are striving, and I cannot wait to explore them.', 'I loved the emphasis on the clock tower at Grand Valley. It is awesome that Grand Valley is known for something so unique and beautiful.

This pretty much summarizes the people at Grand Valley. In our freshman dorm they also told us to leave the door open as much as possible, and people would just walk around from room to room to say hello. They also had seminars for freshman that were all about making friends and adjusting to college. For older students, there are also lots of parties to go to at off-campus apartments, but the actual campus is a dry campus. Tips for prospective students Grand Valley is a great atmosphere to live and learn in. People will smile at you as you walk by and hold doors for you or help you up if you slip in the snow. There are tons of activities for students to do, from clubs and intramurals to watching the exceptional sports teams play, going to concerts and comedians, and watching theater.

It's not scary dorm food, it actually is delicious... which is more reason to take advantage of the rec-center to battle the freshman 15.

In our freshman dorm they also told us to leave the door open as much as possible, and people would just walk around from room to room to say hello. They also had seminars for freshman that were all about making friends and adjusting to college. For older students, there are also lots of parties to go to at off-campus apartments, but the actual campus is a dry campus.

As a freshman, I don't have extensive knowledge of all the classes available, but I am in the honors college and I know that it offers some interesting interdisciplinary studies such as a class about the Holocaust. Programs in science and engineering also have challenging, but enriching courses as well. I don't think they are as rigorous as some larger, more competitive schools, but offer a great learning environment. The class size is usually around 30 so you have the opportunity to build a relationship with your professors."", 'Try to schedule your tour before the worst of winter hits.

In the Fall, there are a tons of apple orchards and cider mills to visit, as well as ArtPrize in Downtown Grand Rapids. Grand Valley always has special guests and events going on for students, for fun or for academics. There is also a club for pretty much anything you could possibly think of and plenty of sports teams that students can join for fun and to meet new people with similar interests. Again, Grand Rapids is about 25 minutes down the road and there is always something going on in the city, or even just exploring Grand Rapids is a fun way to spend the day. There is also the Grandville mall and movie theater as well as a ton of restaurants right by campus if you're looking for a more relaxed evening. There is always something fun to do around campus or in Grand Rapids, you just have to keep your eyes open and have fun no matter what you're doing, that's what college is all about."", ""There are a lot of different food options for Campus dining.

They were a decent size and we had a combined bath room connect with another room, so my roommate and I had two other roommates. There was a kitchen, very large living room area, and had two study rooms and laundry rooms. The only downfall is that the dorms do not have air conditioning, so in those first few months of heat, a fan is definitely a must, but it's a small price to pay for how nice our living was.Everyone was very welcoming and I still have friends from my dorm to this day, but you have to be willing to branch out and be open to meeting new people. The dorm life and Grand Valley is very sufficient and I wouldn't trade my experience in the dorms for anything."", ""Grand Valley professors are usually very decent educators and are challenging, but fair. Now, of course not all of them are great, so don't quote me on this. Some may get the professors that are not from this country or go off topic during lectures, or just seem downright unfair. But this is true for just about any university, no one can have all their expectations met from every professor. Also, this is a college university, so if you are upset about the class being difficult, no one should be upset because it's suppose to be challenging. I have been attending Grand Valley for two years now, and all the staff I have some in contact with truly seem to care about students and their learning. They really try to be available an even reach out to students to help them in any way they can, and that is something that is very important in my perspective. Professors that care about their students are the ones who are going to the teach the most and best, and are going to make sure I get something out that course."", 'Something to be bluntly aware of about Grand Valley is there is a great deal of snow in the winter and it gets very cold, so having a nice air of boots and a cozy winter coat is a must if attending Grand Valley. Something else to be aware of is there are two campuses, one in Allendale and one in Grand Rapids, so you could have a mix of classes in the two areas and that can get a little messy. Despite these small prices to pay, both campuses are beautiful, rain or shine, or snow.', ""Grand Valley has the small town feel with a big city right down the street, so whatever mood you're in, you can get what you want.

This pretty much summarizes the people at Grand Valley. In our freshman dorm they also told us to leave the door open as much as possible, and people would just walk around from room to room to say hello. They also had seminars for freshman that were all about making friends and adjusting to college. For older students, there are also lots of parties to go to at off-campus apartments, but the actual campus is a dry campus. Tips for prospective students Grand Valley is a great atmosphere to live and learn in. People will smile at you as you walk by and hold doors for you or help you up if you slip in the snow.

This pretty much summarizes the people at Grand Valley. In our freshman dorm they also told us to leave the door open as much as possible, and people would just walk around from room to room to say hello. They also had seminars for freshman that were all about making friends and adjusting to college. For older students, there are also lots of parties to go to at off-campus apartments, but the actual campus is a dry campus. Tips for prospective students Grand Valley is a great atmosphere to live and learn in. People will smile at you as you walk by and hold doors for you or help you up if you slip in the snow. There are tons of activities for students to do, from clubs and intramurals to watching the exceptional sports teams play, going to concerts and comedians, and watching theater. Am enjoying being here It was really easy to make friends at Grand Valley. Because of the large number of students, there is many different types of people.

A new onslaught of violence came in 2012, with five murders. One of the few cases to progress from investigation to trial was derailed last year when an eyewitness to the 2011 murder of Geo TV reporter Babar was gunned down two days before he was due to testify. Pakistani news media are vibrant and unified in speaking out against impunity; in March, representatives of dozens of outlets and groups began crafting a plan to improve journalist safety as part of the U.N. effort. But any optimism is tempered by a stark reality: CPJ research shows that journalists face an astonishing array of threats, not only from militants and warlords but from military, security, and government officials., 611=Cases are considered unsolved when no convictions have been obtained. Population data from the World Bank's 2011 World Development Indicators were used in calculating each country's rating., 9148=No journalists have been murdered in Afghanistan since 2008, but authorities have shown no progress in pursuing suspects in the five unsolved cases over the past decade. The most recent victim was Abdul SamadÃ‚Â Rohani, Helmand correspondent for the BBC's Pashto service and a contributor to the Pajhwok Afghan News agency. Rohani, abducted and shot in 2008, had recently reported on drug trafficking and its links to government officials. The planned 2014 withdrawal of NATO troops has raised new concerns about the overall security climate and, with it, the news mediaÃ¢Â€Â™s safety., 13957=In a country with a long history of media killings, 2012 was the deadliest year on record for the press. Twelve journalists were murdered in reprisal for their work in 2012 despite relative calm in the capital, Mogadishu. Given the ouster of Al-Shabaab insurgents from Mogadishu in 2011, the killings raised concern that reporters were being targeted by a widening field of politically motivated antagonists. Journalists with the aggressive Shabelle Media Network paid a high price: Four were slain in 2012 and three in the preceding years. The 2012 victims included Hassan Osman Abdi, known by the nickname Ã¢Â€ÂœFantastic,Ã¢Â€? the networkÃ¢Â€Â™s director and the producer of news programs. Nationwide, 23 journalist murders over the past decade have gone unsolved., 7892=President Enrique PeÃƒÂ±a Nieto has inherited a 90 percent impunity rate in journalist murders. Fifteen slayings have gone unsolved over the past decade, with most of the killings attributed to criminals affiliated with the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s powerful cartels or to corrupt police and government officials. Journalist murders have declined slightly over the past three years, but CPJ research has concluded that the drop is due in part to the self-censorship that has taken hold in virtually every corner of the nation outside the capital. In May 2012, a Nuevo Laredo newspaper officially announced that it would no longer cover anything related to criminal groups. Congress and the states federalized crimes against free expression last year in a series of promising moves designed to move cases out of corrupt local jurisdictions.Ã‚Â , 3055=A steady rise in anti-press violence in recent years has pushed Nigeria onto the index for the first time. With five unsolved murders, it has the second worst impunity rating in Africa, behind only Somalia. Those covering the activities of the extremist Muslim group Boko Haram are particularly vulnerable. In 2012, assailants shot and killed Enenche Akogwu of independent Channels TV as he reported on the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the northern city of Kano., 16386=CPJÃ¢Â€Â™s advocates are leading two campaigns to combat impunity in journalist murders. As part of its Global Campaign Against Impunity, CPJ has persuaded Russian prosecutors to reopen several cold cases; lobbied for MexicoÃ¢Â€Â™s new constitutional amendment federalizing anti-press crimes; and played a role in the development of the U.N. anti-impunity plan and its introduction in Pakistan. In 2012, CPJ launched SpeakJusticeNow.org to mobilize the online community to fight impunity in the digital space., 28046=The release of CPJÃ¢Â€Â™s 2013 index comes at a pivotal moment in the global struggle against impunity. A U.N. plan to combat deadly anti-press violence gets under way this year, with Pakistan being an early focal point. Among its many measures, the plan aims to strengthen journalist safety programs and assist member states in developing ways to prosecute the killers of journalists., 2524=Impunity Index Rating: 0.031 unsolved journalist murders per million inhabitants Last year: Nigeria was not on the 2012 index, 15405=Here are the 12 countries where at least five journalists have been murdered and governments have failed to win any convictions. The index covers the years 2003-12., 20465=This yearÃ¢Â€Â™s index points to other improvements, although they were tempered by lingering problems. Nepal has prosecuted several suspects, though not the masterminds, in the 2009 case of Uma Singh, the last Nepali journalist murdered in connection to her work. But new doubts were raised about the Maoist partyÃ¢Â€Â™s commitment to reversing the culture of impunity when then-Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai objected this year to the arrests of several former party cadres suspected in the 2004 murder of journalist Dakendra Thapa., 31229=Published May 2, 2013, 14839=Iraq has the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s worst record on impunity. No convictions have been obtained in 93 journalist slayings in the past decade. The vast majority of the victims, 95 percent, were local journalists. They include freelance cameraman Tahrir Kadhim Jawad, who was killed on assignment outside Baghdad in 2010 when a bomb attached to his car exploded. Jawad was a Ã¢Â€Âœcourageous cameramanÃ¢Â€? known for getting footage Ã¢Â€Âœwhere others had failed,Ã¢Â€? Mohammad al-Jamili, Baghdad bureau chief for the U.S. government-funded outlet Al-Hurra, said at the time. Police opened an investigation but made no arrests., 12895=Despite President Benigno Aquino III'sÃ‚Â vow to reverse impunity in journalist murders, the Philippines ranked third worst worldwide for the fourth consecutive year. Fifty-five journalist murders have gone unsolved in the past decade. The 2011 Ortega murder reflects the politically inspired nature of the large majority of Philippine killings, along with the general breakdown in the rule of law that has allowed the killings to continue. Ortega, a radio talk show host who exposed corruption, was shot in the back of the head while shopping in a Puerto Princesa City clothing store. Police soon made arrests and traced the murder weapon to a provincial governorÃ¢Â€Â™s aide. But the case suffered a severe blow in 2013 when an alleged conspirator who had turned state witness was killed in prison., 22791=Each time a witness is killed, Ã¢Â€Âœit affects the morale of other witnesses by showcasing how inept the government is in ensuring their safety,Ã¢Â€? says Michaella Ortega. She knows the cycle of intimidation and impunity well: The investigation into the 2011 murder of her father, prominent radio host Gerardo Ortega, was dealt a severe setback when a key witness was killed in jail., 25978=Brazil, which has a long history of anti-press violence, seemed to have turned the corner as recently as 2010, when it briefly dropped off CPJÃ¢Â€Â™s Impunity Index because of declining attacks and a number of successful prosecutions. But a three-year spree of murdersÃ¢Â€Â”many targeting provincial bloggers and online reporters, and all unsolvedÃ¢Â€Â”has shown the gains there to have been illusory. Brazil is ranked 10th worst on the index., 24363=But one case in Pakistan, the 2011 murder of Geo TV reporter Wali Khan Babar, shows how difficult that can be when the rule of law has broken down. Several suspects connected to one of the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s leading political parties, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, are facing trial, but the prosecution has been derailed by the murders of five people connected to the investigation, including witnesses and police officers. In November 2012, an eyewitness was gunned down two days before he was due to give testimony., 1338=CPJ's Impunity Index calculates the number of unsolved journalist murders as a percentage of each country's population. For this index, CPJ examined journalist murders that occurred between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2012, and that remain unsolved. Only those nations with five or more unsolved cases are included on this index., 10196=ColombiaÃ¢Â€Â™s rating showed little change from 2012, but the nation, once one of the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s deadliest for the press, has made steady progress over time. No journalists have been murdered for their work in Colombia since 2010. Improvements in the overall security climate have generally outpaced judicial gains, said Carlos Cortez, one of the founders of the Colombian press freedom group Foundation for a Free Press.Ã‚Â The government provides security directly to journalists under threat. Among the eight unsolved murders over the past decade is the 2003 shooting of Jaime Rengifo Revero, a radio host who had criticized government security efforts in the north. Two former right-wing paramilitary members face charges in the killing., 4102=With nine unsolved cases, BrazilÃ¢Â€Â™s impunity rating has soared in recent years. Despite its expressed commitments to justice, Brazil has recorded no new convictions since 2010. Four journalists were murdered in 2012, the highest annual toll the regional powerhouse has seen in a decade. Three of the four 2012 victims worked for online publications. They included website editor Mario Randolfo Marques Lopes, who had aggressively covered government corruption and police misconduct. Provincial reporters, working out of the national media limelight and in areas where law enforcement is weak or corrupt, have been especially vulnerable in Brazil., 29565=Ã¢Â€ÂœInvestigations into these killings are usually carried out with sloppiness, and no real culprits are caught,Ã¢Â€? said Ayode Longe, a senior officer with the Media Rights Agenda, a press freedom group in Nigeria, where at least five journalists have been murdered in direct relation to their work since 2009. None of the cases has been solved. Ã¢Â€ÂœThat has emboldened others to assault journalists, believing nothing would be done to them,Ã¢Â€? Longe said. Nigeria, which had previously experienced a decade of relative security for journalists, joined the index for the first time this year, ranked as the 11th worst in the world in combating deadly anti-press crime., 2287=Despite its growing international profile, India has lagged in ensuring free expression and the rule of law. No convictions have been won in the cases of six journalists murdered for reporting on local corruption, crime, or politics. Time and again, CPJ research shows, the arrests made after an attack have failed to lead to prosecutions. This is the case for Rajesh Mishra, who died after assailants hit him with iron rods in March 2012. Mishra worked for a Hindi-language weekly and had written about financial irregularities at schools in Rewa. Six suspects were arrested last year but none have been convicted., 5097=With 14 unsolved murder cases since 2003, Russia is the ninth worst country on the index. Journalists in the North Caucuses have been the most vulnerable in recent years; the most recent victim is Kazbek Gekkiyev, a state television anchor working in the region, who was shot three times in December 2012 on his way home from work. RussiaÃ¢Â€Â™s historically poor record in prosecuting journalist killers prompted human rights lawyers and the mother of a journalist missing and presumed dead to submit a case to the European Court of Human Rights arguing that Russia fosters a state pattern of impunity in murders of journalists., 19355=In Russia, ranked ninth worst on the index, prosecutors won the conviction of a former police official on conspiracy charges related to the 2006 slaying of renowned investigative reporter Anna Politkovskaya. While the conviction was a landmark, colleagues and relatives were dismayed that defendant Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov did not have to identify the masterminds in open court, a development they believe diminishes the odds that all of the conspirators will be brought to justice., 11227=Sri LankaÃ¢Â€Â™s impunity rating was unchanged from 2012. But four years after the end of the nationÃ¢Â€Â™s long civil war, President Mahinda RajapaksaÃ¢Â€Â™s administration has shown no interest in pursuing the perpetrators in nine journalist murders over the past decade. All of the victims had reported on politically sensitive issues in ways that were critical of the Rajapaksa government.Ã‚Â The cases include the fatal 2009 beating of prominent newspaper editor Lasantha Wickramatunga. Ã¢Â€ÂœIf there are really independent investigations, many murders and attacks may be traced back to highest-level government politicians and military officials,Ã¢Â€? said Ruki Fernando, a human rights defender formerly with the Law and Society Trust., 22269=CPJÃ¢Â€Â™s analysis found that journalist murders have slowed in Iraq, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Colombia, and AfghanistanÃ¢Â€Â”five Impunity Index countries with long records of deadly, anti-press violence. Despite the decline in murders, however, deep problems remain in each nation. Iraq is still the worst nation on CPJÃ¢Â€Â™s Impunity Index, with more than 90 unsolved journalist murders over the past decade and no sign that authorities are working to solve any of them. While some murders occurred in the anarchy of sectarian violence during the U.S.-led war, many cases could be solved today if authorities demonstrated the will. In Kirkuk, for example, assailants shot freelance writer Soran Mama Hamma in 2008 shortly after he had exposed police complicity in the local prostitution trade., 28503=The Impunity Index, published annually, identifies countries where journalists are murdered regularly and governments fail to solve the crimes. The 2013 index examines journalist murders that occurred from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2012, and remain unsolved. Only nations with five or more unsolved cases are listed. Cases are considered unsolved when no convictions have been won. There are 12 countries on the index this year., 23357=The insecurity of witnesses is a key problem in addressing impunity. Authorities in the Philippines, ranked third worst on CPJÃ¢Â€Â™s index, have yet to make headway in the prosecution of dozens of suspects in a politically motivated massacre in Maguindanao province that claimed the lives of more than 50 people, including 32 journalists and media workers, in 2009. Three witnesses in the Maguindanao case have themselves been murdered, one of them dismembered and mutilated., 21475=Although Colombia has had modest success in solving murders, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Mexico have failed completely in the prosecution of numerous past slayings. These law enforcement failures often lead to another pernicious problem: widespread self-censorship. In Mexico, ranked seventh worst on the index, journalists across the country have told CPJ that they avoid coverage of crime and corruption in order to stay alive. Ã¢Â€ÂœMexican journalists, many of us mothers and fathers, do not want to be silentÃ¢Â€Â”but we do not want to die either,Ã¢Â€? investigative reporter Anabel HernÃƒÂ¡ndez wrote in a November 2012 letter to U.N. delegates, urging them to take action in Mexico under the new anti-impunity plan. Mexican officials did take some significant steps of their own in the past year, adopting a constitutional amendment that gives federal authorities broader authority to prosecute anti-press crimes.}"

In the case of a corporate sponsored event, the sponsor would cover the costs. Very often, however, an informal yet organized (planned) evening at the pub will be sufficient to facilitate networking among conference attendees and speakers.

Whatever you plan, however, be sure to include some free time for people to do things on their own. 1. PLANNING The initial steps in planning are especially important to ensure success. Do all your homework early on. It is better to change course in the planning phase, than having to change things halfway through preparations. Care to do necessary research and do not take anything for granted. Prepare well. Prepare for all possibilities. It is better to over-prepare than under-prepare. And remember, with humor all things get easier. 1.1. Establish preliminary event and dates The amount of planning, committee work, advance deadlines, etc., in part depends on the size event you are planning. A general rule is to allow about a month for every 20 participants. For example, if you are expecting 200 attendees, you should begin to prepare at least 10 months in advance. The general dates and time of the event should be suggested by local variables as well as OWASP speaker availability. For example, it may not be a good idea to plan a conference in Wisconsin in January or Texas in August due to potential weather conditions. Check the OWASP conference schedule to make sure there are not any conflicting events. If you plan to invite out of town speakers, itÃ¢Â€Â™s best to arrange them months in advance. Good speakers and instructors are often booked up to a year in advance. Consider the size and scope of your event. Small groups can be hosted nearly any time. But larger groups will require housing, transportation, and food services that might conflict with other events. Make sure to check the local community events to ensure there will be adequate accessibility to these needs. Having a cohesive, comprehensive plan for your event is key to the success of your event. While all plans change it is important to consider all of the elements listed in the following tabs when developing your conference planning package. Please have a look at the planning time line that OWASP staff has developed to help you get started and keep track of your event. 1.2.

A general rule is to allow about a month for every 20 participants. For example, if you are expecting 200 attendees, you should begin to prepare at least 10 months in advance. The general dates and time of the event should be suggested by local variables as well as OWASP speaker availability. For example, it may not be a good idea to plan a conference in Wisconsin in January or Texas in August due to potential weather conditions. Check the OWASP conference schedule to make sure there are not any conflicting events. If you plan to invite out of town speakers, itÃ¢Â€Â™s best to arrange them months in advance. Good speakers and instructors are often booked up to a year in advance. Consider the size and scope of your event. Small groups can be hosted nearly any time. But larger groups will require housing, transportation, and food services that might conflict with other events. Make sure to check the local community events to ensure there will be adequate accessibility to these needs. Having a cohesive, comprehensive plan for your event is key to the success of your event. While all plans change it is important to consider all of the elements listed in the following tabs when developing your conference planning package. Please have a look at the planning time line that OWASP staff has developed to help you get started and keep track of your event. 1.2.

A great example of a visitor's guide was put together by the AppSec Research 2010 teamThis guide should include sections like:, 148707=0. FIRST THING FIRST What does it take to put together an event with hundred or more people? The hard work over many months includes scheduling of speakersÃ¢Â€Â™ presentations, discussions and workshops, registration of delegates, sorting out catering, accommodation, transport, venues and much more. However, the most crucial effort is in the initial phase, where the core purpose and aim of the gathering is conceived. At the earliest stage, organizers need to ask themselves the deepest questions: Why? Why should we organize this event? What do we want to accomplish by organizing it? Before any other details are discussed, these questions need to be pondered in depth. We may call it a feasibility study. The people who have the initial idea to arrange a conference should take time to probe the proposed topic from every aspect, and answer to this questions: Is this the correct approach to achieve the desired results? The event must meet the desired level of a return on investment just as a product research and development project would have to demonstrate. 1. CONTENT In order to hold an event you need first to have the content, which is the reason why people are attending the event! Spending the time, energy and money organizing a conference is worthless unless you can assure people will sign up. Whatever niche youÃ¢Â€Â™re planning to organize a conference within, make sure there is sufficient demand. Once you realize thereÃ¢Â€Â™s sufficient demand for your niche, you want to decide what type of content you want to deliver on even days. Think broadly at this point. What are the areas you want conference presentations to be focused on? Try to make your conference stand out. What are the hooks that are going to assure people in your niche get excited about the event? Are there any hot topics going on in your industry? Are there any controversial debates happening in your industry? Is there a new breakthrough in your industry people are dying to learn more about? International meetings usually have a general theme. However, for regional meetings, you may want to choose a theme that reflects your chapter's particular strengths or interests. A good program is critical. Look for variety, interest, timeliness. What do your members need or want to leave with? Try to balance lectures with discussions, hands on, social activities, and time for colleague interaction. While it is acceptable to target individuals/companies to solicit content, in keeping with the OWASP value of openness, all Call for Papers and Call for Training must be open to all to submit. Calls for Papers or Training must be at a minimum announced on the conference Wiki page. After a long intensive day of speakers and/or training, a more casual opportunity for networking will be welcomed by most all attendees. Depending on the size and location of your event you may want to consider one or several of the following options: OWASP ""meet up"" at a local pub, OWASP gala dinner, Corporate sponsored party, Guided site seeing tours, Group outing to a sporting event, etc. In many cases you can include an optional fee to be paid to cover the costs of the event. In the case of a corporate sponsored event, the sponsor would cover the costs. Very often, however, an informal yet organized (planned) evening at the pub will be sufficient to facilitate networking among conference attendees and speakers. Be sure to remind everyone at the end of the last talk for the day of the location of the gathering, the cost (if any), and the start time for the next days speakers. Whatever you plan, however, be sure to include some free time for people to do things on their own. 1. PLANNING The initial steps in planning are especially important to ensure success. Do all your homework early on. It is better to change course in the planning phase, than having to change things halfway through preparations. Care to do necessary research and do not take anything for granted. Prepare well. Prepare for all possibilities. It is better to over-prepare than under-prepare. And remember, with humor all things get easier. 1.1.

To help mitigate the impact of an XSS flaw on your site, OWASP also recommends you set the HTTPOnly flag on your session cookie and any custom cookies you have that are not accessed by any Javascript you wrote. This cookie flag is typically on by default in .NET apps, but in other languages you have to set it manually. For more details on the HTTPOnly cookie flag, including what it does, and how to use it, see the OWASP article on HTTPOnly.

This is true of position players as well, but an injury to one position player will usually have a lesser impact on the week-to-week results.) Utilizing our award-winning baseball simulation engine, WhatIfSports.com presents the most comprehensive and unbiased ranking of all 30 MLB teams each Monday during the regular season. The rankings are generated using the up-to-date statistical performance of each team.

Aunque no existe un lÃƒÂ­mite definido en cuanto al nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces que deberÃƒÂ­a incluir en una pÃƒÂ¡gina, es mejor limitar el nÃƒÂºmero de enlaces a 200 por pÃƒÂ¡gina. Los enlaces pasan valor de una pÃƒÂ¡gina a otra, pero la cantidad o el valor que se puede pasar se divide entre todos los enlaces en una pÃƒÂ¡gina. Esto significa que la adiciÃƒÂ³n de enlaces innecesarios diluirÃƒÂ¡ el valor potencial atribuido a los demÃƒÂ¡s enlaces. Utilizar el atributo Nofollow impide que los vÃƒÂ­nculos transmitan valor a otras pÃƒÂ¡ginas, pero es interesante observar que estos enlaces siempre se aÃƒÂ±aden a la ecuaciÃƒÂ³n en el momento de calcular el valor que se pasa a travÃƒÂ©s de cada enlace.
