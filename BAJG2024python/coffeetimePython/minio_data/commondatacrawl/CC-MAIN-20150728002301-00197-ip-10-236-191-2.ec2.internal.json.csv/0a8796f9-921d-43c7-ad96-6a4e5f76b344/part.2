After more than a decade of near-constant operation, the current system was still serving the museum, a testament to the outstanding quality of Christie products.

Foye opened the extra period with a jumper, and Utah led the rest of the way. The Jazz shot 4-for-6 and improved in two areas where it struggled for most of the game -- ball movement and getting to the free-throw line. The Kings, meanwhile, fell apart, shooting 3-for-8 while committing two turnovers including a pass by Evans that landed in the fifth row. A jumper by Paul Millsap with 1:06 remaining gave the Jazz a 92-87 lead and iced the game. Foye scored six points in overtime., 15651=Utah went on an 8-0 run, Foye hitting a 3, Marvin Williams a pair of free throws then another 3 with 2:40 remaining to give Utah an 83-82 lead., 11725=Paul Millsap added 14, with a key block, a step-back jumper and a rebound in the extra session for the Jazz, who used an 8-0 fourth-quarter run to take the lead with 2:40 left in regulation., 10726=SALT LAKE CITY (AP) It was only a matter of time after DeMarcus Cousins got his first technical with 2:23 left in the second quarter of Monday night's game against the Utah Jazz., 21874=BAD MOVE: Cousins hurt his team by bickering with officials and getting booted from the game. He picked up his second technical foul as he was walking into the locker room at halftime. His first came with 2:23 remaining in the second quarter when he said something to anger an official who was standing approximately 20 feet away from him. Cousins, instead of just going into the locker room for the break, stopped to argue with officials and earned another technical. Cousins leads the league with 12 technical fouls. He has been ejected in two games this season, and both of them were in Utah., 15469=The first time, the Kings won 108-97 on Nov. 24., 15588=The Kings led 82-75 lead with 4:26 remaining., 13973=Before that he had a steal, then grabbed the rebound that set Millsap up for the winning 19-footer with 1:06 left in OT., 8251=Sacramento (17-32) is 5-20 on the road, but has given the Jazz a tough time lately. The Kings have taken four of the last seven meetings, winning 108-97 at home Nov. 24., 7582=Aside from a franchise-record 45-point loss to Houston on Jan. 28, the Jazz have allowed just 93.4 points on 43.2 percent shooting in their last eight home games., 21322=GOOD MOVE: Jazz coach Tyrone Corbin played Burks instead of starter Jamaal Tinsley at point guard the entire fourth quarter and overtime and the move paid dividends. Burks, a shooting guard, ran the offense efficiently and dished four assists in the fourth quarter. In overtime, he swished a 20-foot jumper with 2:39 left to give Utah a 90-87 lead. Burks is a much more athletic alternative to Tinsley, and the Jazz might not have won if Corbin hadn't played him down the stretch., 19662=HOT: The Jazz's bench shot 17-for-26 with Burks and Favors each finishing 5-for-7. Utah shot a season-high 58.3 percent from 3-point range. Thompson, who returned to Sacramento's starting lineup after a one-game absence, recorded his first double-double since Jan. 2.}",,"{3140=9:00 PM ET - EnergySolutions Arena, Salt Lake City, UT}"

The Bobcats can create considerable salary-cap room this summer Ã¢Â€Â“ as much as $21 million Ã¢Â€Â“ but that would require several steps starting with amnestying Tyrus Thomas. The Bobcats say theyÃ¢Â€Â™ll pay the large salary required to snag a major free agent. But their challenge is finding someone who would agree to come to Charlotte, and who is young enough to lead the team in the future after it has more time to develop. Of this free agent group, Al Jefferson, Paul Millsap or J.J. Hickson could improve low-post scoring, an area of need. But Jefferson and Millsap, both with Utah last season, have logged considerable time already in the NBA. Restricted free agents tend to be hard to sign, since their former teams can match offers.

Here are some names that could be available in July of 2014: Sacramento Kings center DeMarcus Cousins would be a restricted free agent, assuming he doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t sign an extension. Cousins has been very high-maintenance, but the Bobcats are often linked to chatter about trading for him. Former Duke small forward Luol Deng, whoÃ¢Â€Â™s spent his career with the Chicago Bulls, would be an unrestricted free agent at the end of next season. Would he still be young enough after 10 NBA seasons to make a difference in Charlotte? Point guard John Wall, who grew up in Raleigh, would be a restricted free agent. The Wizards have abundant incentive to retain Wall.

Those that are merely spelling variants are discussed above in 21.4.1. Some other verbs have forms that are used exclusively or preferentially in only one dialect. A few verbs (some mentioned in 3.2.1 ) have a participle form ending in -t that is not used in US English when the verb appears as part of a finite verb phrase. These formsÃ¢Â€Â”burnt, leant, learnt, smelt, spelt, spilt, and spoiltÃ¢Â€Â”are not used in US English and should be replaced by their -ed equivalents when Americanizing text. Burnt is occasionally used in US English as an adjective. Special attention should be given to the participles got and gotten, since British English does not use the latter as a past participle of get. When Briticizing text, all instances of gotten can simply be changed to got. When Americanizing, it is necessary to distinguish the various senses of get. US English uses got in verb phrases where the verb means Ã¢Â€Â˜possessÃ¢Â€Â™ (I've got a beach house in Florida) and Ã¢Â€Â˜have as an obligationÃ¢Â€Â™ (IÃ¢Â€Â™ve got to go to Chicago next week). Gotten is the preferred form when the verb means Ã¢Â€Â˜obtainÃ¢Â€Â™ (Have you gotten your results yet?) and Ã¢Â€Â˜becomeÃ¢Â€Â™ (She hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t gotten any prettier over the years). Gotten is also more usual in US English in a number",True,0,0,,,
