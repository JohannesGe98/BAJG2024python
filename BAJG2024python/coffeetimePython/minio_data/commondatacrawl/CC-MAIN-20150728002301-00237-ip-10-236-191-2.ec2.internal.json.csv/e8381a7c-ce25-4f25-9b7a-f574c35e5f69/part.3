Recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and other hot spots around the world lend some impetus to their cause, and the threat of lost jobs is always a potent argument. But contractors increasingly have faced the reality of a very tight government budget with little room for expensive tactical fighter planes, missile systems and stealth bombers. Of course, this doesn't mean defense contractors don't try very hard to sell their wares - both with vigorous lobbying and targeted campaign contributions. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), Chair Sen.
