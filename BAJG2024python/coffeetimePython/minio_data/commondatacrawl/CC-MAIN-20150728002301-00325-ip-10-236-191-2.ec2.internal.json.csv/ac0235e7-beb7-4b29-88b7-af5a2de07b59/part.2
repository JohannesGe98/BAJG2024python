When we declare a member _attributes with a HelloAttributes type, it is distinct from the _attributes member in the base class. Remember to cast it correctly ((HelloAttributes)_attributes).someMember when accessing HelloAttributes members.

In the charter it was declared that Ã¢Â€Âœthe fundamental conditions and resources for health are peace, shelter, education, food, income, a stable ecosystem, sustainable resources, social justice and equity. Improvement in health requires a secure foundation in these basic prerequisitesÃ¢Â€? [12] (it is in this same year that the WHO Healthy Cities initiative was born, a movement that harkens back to the Victorian era sanitary reforms [8]). This list of conditions specifically credits the reliance on a stable ecosystem and sustainable resources as Ã¢Â€Âœfundamental conditionsÃ¢Â€? for health (the term Ã¢Â€ÂœstableÃ¢Â€? to denote viable ecosystems is no longer in vogue. It is now understood that a viable ecosystem may constantly be in a state of flux and that its resilience is what is critical to maintain ecosystem functionality). Practitioners of the new (post-1986) public health were seen as needing Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â¦a good grounding in ecology and a vision of how to reconcile the natural and the built environmentsÃ¢Â€? [13]. The new public health was charged with revisiting Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â¦all the topics of the old public healthÃ¢Â€Â”housing, food, water, sanitation, education, occupation, transportation, genetics and microbiology, and medical and social servicesÃ¢Â€Â”and reexamine them with ecological eyesÃ¢Â€? [13] because Ã¢Â€ÂœÃ¢Â€Â¦with many public health issues, several elements must be dealt with in order truly to solve the larger problemÃ¢Â€? [4]. The Ottawa Charter codified that the natural environment was necessary to deliver many of the fundamental conditions for health. As is outlined in the following section, over the nearly 30 years since the Ottawa Charter, natural environment constructs have been represented with varying degrees of sophistication in ecological models of health.}",

However, we expect that even if such sourceÃ¢Â€Â“body connections were not made, that such metrics would be better than in a PDSOI process. Since these were designed to operate at ultra-low power, self-heating and temperature concerns were not important. Furthermore the kink effects are usually observed at voltages above 1 V, thus the risk of kink effect can be omitted as devices were operating below the voltage of concern and were optimized to work in sub-threshold. In essence, the technology seemed ideal for ultra-low voltage and low power operation. 12 Since the amplifiers presented here are differential pairs, in layout all the transistors have their source local-body tied to eliminate any potential floating body effects and to ensure better matching, linearity and more stable VT over voltage [ ]: 11","jlpea-02-00155-t002_Table 2 Table 2 NMOS differential pair OTA simulation results.

However, we expect that even if such sourceÃ¢Â€Â“body connections were not made, that such metrics would be better than in a PDSOI process. Since these were designed to operate at ultra-low power, self-heating and temperature concerns were not important. Furthermore the kink effects are usually observed at voltages above 1 V, thus the risk of kink effect can be omitted as devices were operating below the voltage of concern and were optimized to work in sub-threshold. In essence, the technology seemed ideal for ultra-low voltage and low power operation. 12 Since the amplifiers presented here are differential pairs, in layout all the transistors have their source local-body tied to eliminate any potential floating body effects and to ensure better matching, linearity and more stable VT over voltage [ ]: 11","0.4 0.15 19.7 92 18.3 1.05 0.35 0.15 10.1 107 10.5 1.05 jlpea-02-00155-t002_Table 2 Table 2 NMOS differential pair OTA simulation results.

I was surprised and almost shocked at the quality of the food and the amassing atmosphere of the restaurant. From that day forward I have not missed at least two dinners there a week. I also presented it to my colleagues with great enthusiasm. Finally I found a real authentic Italian restaurant in New York. Their Fettucine reminds me of my grandmothers dishes, and the Branzino ""sea bass"" reminds me of my last vacation to Sardinia.

Alors quÃ¢Â€Â™il a longtemps ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  la mÃƒÂªme hauteur que le Costa Rica et que son ÃƒÂ©quipe nationale brille, le Honduras est en net recul quand on parle de clubs.

Made in NYC by MLS Digital, 113648=De lÃ¢Â€Â™autre cÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ© de lÃ¢Â€Â™Atlantique, deux duels ont fait couler le plus dÃ¢Â€Â™encre. LÃ¢Â€Â™un dÃ¢Â€Â™entre eux est le plus ancien dÃ¢Â€Â™entre tousÃ‚Â : Angleterre - ÃƒÂ‰cosse. La premiÃƒÂ¨re de leurs 112 confrontations a eu lieu le 30 novembre 1872 ÃƒÂ  Glasgow et sÃ¢Â€Â™est soldÃƒÂ©e par un nul 0-0. Il faut dire que jusquÃ¢Â€Â™en 1989, les deux ÃƒÂ©quipes sÃ¢Â€Â™affrontaient au moins une fois par an et que cÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tait toujours un bon prÃƒÂ©texte ÃƒÂ  exacerber la rivalitÃƒÂ© historique entre ces deux parties de la Grande-Bretagne. Le bilan est relativement ÃƒÂ©quilibrÃƒÂ© (46 victoires anglaises, 41 ÃƒÂ©cossaises, 25 partages). Quelques duels marquantsÃ‚Â : la victoire 9-3 de lÃ¢Â€Â™Angleterre en 1961, la victoire 2-3 des ÃƒÂ‰cossais ÃƒÂ  Wembley en 1967 sur le terrain des champions du monde en titre qui nÃ¢Â€Â™avaient plus perdu depuis 19 rencontres ou encore la victoire 2-0 des Anglais lors de leur Euro en 1996. Pour en savoir plus sur ce derby, regardez la vidÃƒÂ©o ci-dessus (en anglais)., 133788=Tous les duels entre les deux pays sont ÃƒÂ  nouveau prÃƒÂ©textes ÃƒÂ  polÃƒÂ©mique. DÃ¢Â€Â™autant plus quand il y a des incidents sur le terrain, comme les cinq exclusions lors de la Copa America 1991 ou le but de la main accordÃƒÂ© au BrÃƒÂ©sil lors de la mÃƒÂªme compÃƒÂ©tition quatre ans plus tard. Mais mÃƒÂªme en dehors, il est difficile de les dÃƒÂ©partager et de les mettre dÃ¢Â€Â™accord. Quand on regarde le palmarÃƒÂ¨s de la Coupe du monde, le BrÃƒÂ©sil domine nettement. Si on se fie aux compÃƒÂ©titions continentales, lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentine a le dessus. Et puis, il y a le sempiternel dÃƒÂ©bat sur le meilleur joueur de lÃ¢Â€Â™histoireÃ‚Â : PelÃƒÂ© ou Maradona, qui divise encore bien plus que la prÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rence pour le tango ou la samba., 127395=LÃ¢Â€Â™autre incontournable dans la Concacaf est le duel entre le Honduras et le Salvador, qui se sont affrontÃƒÂ©s 61 fois. LÃ¢Â€Â™une dÃ¢Â€Â™entre elles est (tristement) cÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ¨bre sous le nom de Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Guerre du footballÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». En 1969, la tension diplomatique est ÃƒÂ  son comble entre les deux pays, pour des questions territoriales et politiques (de nombreux Salvadoriens vivent de lÃ¢Â€Â™autre cÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ© de la frontiÃƒÂ¨re, pour la plupart des paysans quÃ¢Â€Â™aucune des deux nations ne semble souhaiter accueillir). CÃ¢Â€Â™est dans ce contexte quÃ¢Â€Â™ils sÃ¢Â€Â™affrontent lors de duels dÃƒÂ©cisifs des ÃƒÂ©liminatoires de la Coupe du monde 1970. Si le Salvador se qualifie, on retiendra surtout les ÃƒÂ©chauffourÃƒÂ©es entre supporters, parallÃƒÂ¨lement auxquelles les deux armÃƒÂ©es sÃ¢Â€Â™engagent dans une guerre sanglante, dont le ballon rond nÃ¢Â€Â™est pas la cause premiÃƒÂ¨re., 116846=NÃƒÂ©anmoins, les deux pays europÃƒÂ©ens qui ont le plus souvent jouÃƒÂ© lÃ¢Â€Â™un contre lÃ¢Â€Â™autre sont lÃ¢Â€Â™Autriche et la HongrieÃ‚Â : 136 face-ÃƒÂ -face officiels sont recensÃƒÂ©s. Les deux pays ÃƒÂ©taient deux puissances du soccer avant la Seconde guerre mondiale et se sont rÃƒÂ©guliÃƒÂ¨rement rencontrÃƒÂ©s jusque dans les annÃƒÂ©es 1960, mais leurs duels ont diminuÃƒÂ© autant que leur lustre par la suite, ce qui donne moins de piment ÃƒÂ  cette rivalitÃƒÂ© aujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui. Notons aussi que la SuÃƒÂ¨de a jouÃƒÂ© 103 fois contre la NorvÃƒÂ¨ge et 101 contre le Danemark.

Il y a en effet prÃƒÂ¨s de six ans que la Major League Soccer, Arthur Blank, les dirigeants des Falcons et dÃ¢Â€Â™AMB Group, sociÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© mÃƒÂ¨re du nouveau club de MLS et des Falcons, collaborent pour amener du soccer de haut niveau ÃƒÂ  Atlanta. Le groupe sÃ¢Â€Â™est notamment rendu dans six marchÃƒÂ©s de MLS pour discuter des activitÃƒÂ©s dÃ¢Â€Â™exploitation des clubs et visiter des stades, et a menÃƒÂ© des discussions avec six autres ÃƒÂ©quipes de MLS., 119956=ÃƒÂ‰tonnamment, en Afrique, on ne retrouve pas dÃ¢Â€Â™affrontement entre pays de soccer voisins qui ont eu lieu 50 fois au plus. CÃ¢Â€Â™est en partie dÃƒÂ» au fait que la dÃƒÂ©colonisation nÃ¢Â€Â™a eu lieu que lors de la deuxiÃƒÂ¨me moitiÃƒÂ© du XXe siÃƒÂ¨cle, mais pas seulement. CÃ¢Â€Â™est cependant lÃƒÂ  et dans ce contexte quÃ¢Â€Â™on retrouve une histoire de solidaritÃƒÂ© entre nations qui partagent une frontiÃƒÂ¨re. En 1958, luttant pour son indÃƒÂ©pendance, lÃ¢Â€Â™AlgÃƒÂ©rie (alors franÃƒÂ§aise) monte une ÃƒÂ©quipe composÃƒÂ©e dÃ¢Â€Â™excellents joueurs, dont certains sont sous contrat dans de grands clubs franÃƒÂ§ais. LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe nÃ¢Â€Â™est (ÃƒÂ©videmment) pas reconnue par la Fifa et les autres pays hÃƒÂ©sitent ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™affronter de peur dÃ¢Â€Â™un incident diplomatique avec la France. La Tunisie, prÃƒÂ´nant la solidaritÃƒÂ© panarabe, lui offre dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂªtre son port dÃ¢Â€Â™attache et est son premier adversaire en match amical. LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe du FLN (Front de libÃƒÂ©ration nationale) devient un symbole et, durant quatre ans, effectue des tournÃƒÂ©es en Europe de lÃ¢Â€Â™Est et en Asie. Durant tout ce temps, les joueurs sont suspendus par leur club, mais ils peuvent y retourner en 1962 et y sont bien accueillis. Depuis lÃ¢Â€Â™indÃƒÂ©pendance, AlgÃƒÂ©rie et Tunisie ont jouÃƒÂ© lÃ¢Â€Â™une contre lÃ¢Â€Â™autre une quarantaine de fois., 122172=Parmi les anciennes colonies franÃƒÂ§aises en Afrique de lÃ¢Â€Â™Ouest, le SÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©gal avait la rÃƒÂ©putation dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂªtre le prÃƒÂ©fÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© de lÃ¢Â€Â™occupant en matiÃƒÂ¨re de culture et de sport. AprÃƒÂ¨s lÃ¢Â€Â™indÃƒÂ©pendance, il est donc devenu un rival naturel de ses voisins dans ces domaines. La GuinÃƒÂ©e est celui quÃ¢Â€Â™il a affrontÃƒÂ© le plus souvent (40 fois)Ã‚Â : le rÃƒÂ©gime dÃ¢Â€Â™extrÃƒÂªme gauche de celle-ci pousse son ÃƒÂ©quipe ÃƒÂ  la victoire pour montrer la suprÃƒÂ©matie de son idÃƒÂ©ologie face au Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â suppÃƒÂ´t de lÃ¢Â€Â™impÃƒÂ©rialismeÃ‚Â Ã‚Â». LÃ¢Â€Â™esprit sportif domine toutefois, car il y a un grand respect pour le sport et les sportifs. La CÃƒÂ´te dÃ¢Â€Â™Ivoire est lÃ¢Â€Â™autre rival historique du SÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©gal, avec un contexte colonial identique mais politique diffÃƒÂ©rent. LÃƒÂ  ÃƒÂ©galement, tout sÃ¢Â€Â™est toujours passÃƒÂ© dans la fraternitÃƒÂ©. Mais quand lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe ivoirienne a commencÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  rivaliser avec son adversaire, notamment en reportant la Coupe dÃ¢Â€Â™Afrique des nations 1992 ÃƒÂ  Dakar, tout un peuple a fÃƒÂªtÃƒÂ© cette sortie de lÃ¢Â€Â™ombre., 128330=Le podium des duels internationaux les plus frÃƒÂ©quents de lÃ¢Â€Â™histoire est composÃƒÂ© de Belgique - Pays-Bas, Autiche - Hongrie (rivalitÃƒÂ©s dont nous parlerons plus tard cette semaine), et sa premiÃƒÂ¨re marche est occupÃƒÂ©e par le derby sud-amÃƒÂ©ricain entre lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentine et lÃ¢Â€Â™Uruguay, qui se sont affrontÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  180 reprises, voire plus. Le premier duel officiellement recensÃƒÂ© par la Fifa date de 1902, mais il y en eut dÃ¢Â€Â™autres, avant et aprÃƒÂ¨s, non reconnus, notamment le match du 16 mai 1901 considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ© comme la premiÃƒÂ¨re rencontre internationale en dehors du Royaume Uni. De nombreux Britanniques sÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©taient ÃƒÂ©tablis autour du rio de la Plata (fleuve qui sÃƒÂ©pare les deux pays), rejoints par la suite par dÃ¢Â€Â™autres EuropÃƒÂ©ens, notamment des ItaliensÃ‚Â : Montevideo et Buenos Aires voulaient montrer ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™autre quÃ¢Â€Â™ils avaient la meilleure faÃƒÂ§on de faire, y compris avec un ballon. Deux styles diffÃƒÂ©rents se sont dÃƒÂ©veloppÃƒÂ©sÃ‚Â : les Uruguayens disent quÃ¢Â€Â™ils ont du caractÃƒÂ¨re et trouvent leurs voisins sournois et peu virilsÃ‚Â ; les Argentins vantent leur jeu de passes et traitent les joueurs adverses de bouchers., 141914=Les statistiques retiendront quÃ¢Â€Â™en 2014, une seule ÃƒÂ©quipe de MLS a remportÃƒÂ© ses trois premiÃƒÂ¨res rencontres de championnatÃ‚Â : Columbus. Une rÃƒÂ©ussite pour une ÃƒÂ©quipe remodelÃƒÂ©e qui, en outre, a gagnÃƒÂ© deux fois ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™extÃƒÂ©rieur. Le dernier dÃƒÂ©placement en date nÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tait pas des plus simplesÃ‚Â : ÃƒÂ  Seattle, qui a ouvert la marque, mais a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© rÃƒÂ©duit ÃƒÂ  dix aux alentours de lÃ¢Â€Â™heure de jeu, moment de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©galisation. Les visiteurs en voulaient plus et juste avant les arrÃƒÂªts de jeu, Gregg Berhalter a fait monter Meram et lui a demandÃƒÂ© de marquer. Il lÃ¢Â€Â™a faitÃ‚Â ! Sur ce but, les joueurs locaux ÃƒÂ©taient distraitsÃ¢Â€Â¦ par lÃ¢Â€Â™arbitre, plaident-ils., 114705=La Belgique et les Pays-Bas se sont affrontÃƒÂ©s encore davantageÃ‚Â : 123 fois, ÃƒÂ  partir de 1905. En 1910, le NÃƒÂ©erlandais Arnold HÃƒÂ¶rburger se blesse sÃƒÂ©rieusement en premiÃƒÂ¨re mi-temps et court comme un lapin en deuxiÃƒÂ¨meÃ‚Â : les Belges soupÃƒÂ§onnent son jumeau Anton de lÃ¢Â€Â™avoir remplacÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ  la pause (les changements nÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©taient pas permis ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©poque). La dÃƒÂ©faite nÃƒÂ©erlandaise 7-6 en 1951 inspire ÃƒÂ  Jan de Cler Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Hup Holland HupÃ‚Â Ã‚Â», dont le refrain est devenu aujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui la chanson traditionnelle des Oranje. En fait, De Cler travaillait pour la radio nÃƒÂ©erlandaise, qui diffusait les rencontres de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©quipe nationale, et ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™issue de chaque mi-temps, il les racontait de maniÃƒÂ¨re lyrique. Ensuite, avec des chÃ…Â“urs, il entonnait la chanson (vous pouvez mÃƒÂªme ÃƒÂ©couter ÃƒÂ§a ici dans ce document dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©poque)., 130907=Mais de nos jours, quand on parle de rivalitÃƒÂ© en AmÃƒÂ©rique du Sud, on pense immÃƒÂ©diatement ÃƒÂ  BrÃƒÂ©sil - Argentine. Les deux pays se sont affrontÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  95 reprises ÃƒÂ  partir de 1914. Un bilan on ne peut plus ÃƒÂ©quilibrÃƒÂ© avec 36 victoires argentines, 35 brÃƒÂ©siliennes et 24 nulsÃ‚Â ! Politiquement, il nÃ¢Â€Â™y a plus de tension entre les deux pays depuis le XIXe siÃƒÂ¨cle mais culturellement, ils sont partis dans des directions diamÃƒÂ©tralement opposÃƒÂ©es et la manifestation de ce choc est exacerbÃƒÂ©e autour dÃ¢Â€Â™un ballon rond. Si quand ils se comparent ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™Uruguay, les Argentins se considÃƒÂ¨rent comme des esthÃƒÂ¨tes, les BrÃƒÂ©siliens revendiquent le joga bonito et disent que pour leur voisin, seule la victoire importe, peu importe la maniÃƒÂ¨re., 66467=LÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©mission de cette semaine (ÃƒÂ  ÃƒÂ©couter ici) a des airs de voyage ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™hÃƒÂ´pitalÃ‚Â : passage ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tage des grands malades avec cinq ÃƒÂ©quipes qui nÃ¢Â€Â™ont toujours pas gagnÃƒÂ©, mais aussi rÃƒÂ©jouissances avec le retour en forme de Clint Dempsey et dÃƒÂ©tour par la maternitÃƒÂ© avec lÃ¢Â€Â™arrivÃƒÂ©e dÃ¢Â€Â™Atlanta en MLS prÃƒÂ©vue pour 2017., 132639=Ce fut plus civilisÃƒÂ© par la suite, jusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  leur rencontre lors de la Coupe du monde 1978. Un 0-0 qui ne reste pas dans les mÃƒÂ©moires pour son esthÃƒÂ©tisme. CÃ¢Â€Â™est au deuxiÃƒÂ¨me tour oÃƒÂ¹ lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentine bat le PÃƒÂ©rou 6-0 lors de son dernier match pour devancer ÃƒÂ  la diffÃƒÂ©rence de buts le BrÃƒÂ©sil, qui soupÃƒÂ§onne ouvertement un match truquÃƒÂ©. La rivalitÃƒÂ© en phase finale de Coupe du monde se poursuit quatre ans plus tard, au mÃƒÂªme stade de la compÃƒÂ©titionÃ‚Â : pas de scandale cette fois, et une victoire brÃƒÂ©silienne facile lors dÃ¢Â€Â™un match marquÃƒÂ© par lÃ¢Â€Â™exclusion directe de Diego Maradona. En 1990, les rivaux sud-amÃƒÂ©ricains se retrouvent en huitiÃƒÂ¨me de finale du Mondiale italien. CÃ¢Â€Â™est le retour de la polÃƒÂ©miqueÃ‚Â : assoiffÃƒÂ©, le dÃƒÂ©fenseur brÃƒÂ©silien Branco reÃƒÂ§oit une bouteille dÃ¢Â€Â™eau des Argentins. Un geste sportif qui, selon les battus, ÃƒÂ©tait en fait un piÃƒÂ¨ge puisque des tranquillisants auraient ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© mÃƒÂ©langÃƒÂ©s au liquideÃ¢Â€Â¦, 121371=Le duel le plus frÃƒÂ©quent entre nations africaines ayant un beau palmarÃƒÂ¨s oppose deux anciennes colonies anglaises, le Nigeria et le Ghana, qui se sont affrontÃƒÂ©s ÃƒÂ  une cinquantaine de reprises. LÃ¢Â€Â™anecdote la plus folklorique remonte ÃƒÂ  1958, quand la femme dÃ¢Â€Â™un dirigeant ghanÃƒÂ©en est montÃƒÂ©e sur le terrain pour gifler lÃ¢Â€Â™arbitre, provoquant une interruption du match pendant 20 minutes. Sur la scÃƒÂ¨ne continentale, le Ghana domine son rival mais doit attendre 2006 pour se qualifier pour la Coupe du monde, ÃƒÂ  laquelle le Nigeria a participÃƒÂ© dÃƒÂ¨s 1994 et plus souvent. Rarement lÃ¢Â€Â™un des deux peut savourer longtemps une victoire sur son rival, qui prend gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©ralement sa revanche assez rapidement., 56933=On attendait une annonce importante ce mercredi, et il nÃ¢Â€Â™y avait guÃƒÂ¨re de suspense puisquÃ¢Â€Â™elle ÃƒÂ©tait intitulÃƒÂ©e Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Atlanta 2017Ã‚Â Ã‚Â». Le commissaire de la Major League Soccer, Don Garber, a ainsi annoncÃƒÂ© que la 22e ÃƒÂ©quipe de MLS jouerait dans la capitale de la GÃƒÂ©orgie ÃƒÂ  partir de 2017. Elle se produira dans le mÃƒÂªme stade que le club de NFL de la ville, une enceinte qui doit ÃƒÂªtre bientÃƒÂ´t construite en plein centre dÃ¢Â€Â™Atlanta, et en aura le mÃƒÂªme propriÃƒÂ©taire, Arthur Blank., 126722=Les ÃƒÂ‰tats-Unis ont le beau rÃƒÂ´le en ce moment, et ont surnommÃƒÂ© ce match Ã‚Â«Ã‚Â Dos a ceroÃ‚Â Ã‚Â» (Deux - zÃƒÂ©ro) en raison de la victoire des leurs sur ce score lors des quatre confrontations entre les deux pays ÃƒÂ  Columbus (2001, 2005, 2009 et 2013, chaque fois lors des ÃƒÂ©liminatoires de la Coupe du monde) ainsi que lors de leur unique affrontement en phase finale de Coupe du monde, en huitiÃƒÂ¨mes de finale de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©dition 2002. Si vous comprenez lÃ¢Â€Â™espagnol, lisez cet article qui revient sur les moments marquants de cette rivalitÃƒÂ©., 131807=MÃƒÂªme si avant la Seconde guerre mondiale, seule lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentine ÃƒÂ©tait considÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©e comme une puissance internationale, cÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©tait toujours serrÃƒÂ© sur le terrain. Et souvent trÃƒÂ¨s tendu. ÃƒÂ€ la fin des annÃƒÂ©es 1930, les deux ÃƒÂ©quipes ont tour ÃƒÂ  tour quittÃƒÂ© le terrain avant le coup de sifflet finalÃ‚Â : en 1937, les BrÃƒÂ©siliens nÃ¢Â€Â™ont pas terminÃƒÂ© un match teintÃƒÂ© de racisme ÃƒÂ  Buenos AiresÃ‚Â ; deux ans plus tard, les Argentins sont partis pour protester contre lÃ¢Â€Â™arbitrage ÃƒÂ  Rio. En 1946, le BrÃƒÂ©silien Pinto casse la jambe de lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentin SalomonÃ‚Â : bagarre gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rale et envahissement de terrain. Si on arrive ÃƒÂ  terminer le match, les deux pays sÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©vitent pendant 10 ans., 61619=En mars 2017, la nouvelle ÃƒÂ©quipe de MLS ÃƒÂ  Atlanta devrait organiser le premier ÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ¨nement sportif dans le stade ultramoderne muni dÃ¢Â€Â™un toit rÃƒÂ©tractable oÃƒÂ¹ tant le club de soccer que celui de football amÃƒÂ©ricain ÃƒÂ©liront domicile. Pour les rencontres de MLS, le stade aura une configuration plus intime, avec une capacitÃƒÂ© de 29Ã‚Â 322 places assises. SituÃƒÂ©e au centre-ville, lÃ¢Â€Â™enceinte sera facile dÃ¢Â€Â™accÃƒÂ¨s en transports en commun., 64070=LÃ¢Â€Â™ajout dÃ¢Â€Â™Atlanta en 2017 portera le nombre de clubs en MLS ÃƒÂ  22 et sÃ¢Â€Â™inscrit dans la stratÃƒÂ©gie dÃ¢Â€Â™en compter 24 dÃ¢Â€Â™ici 2020. Ils sont actuellement 19 et seront 21 dÃƒÂ¨s lÃ¢Â€Â™an prochain, avec les arrivÃƒÂ©es de New York City et Orlando. Il y a fort ÃƒÂ  parier que le 23e sera Miami, avec David Beckham ÃƒÂ  sa tÃƒÂªteÃ‚Â : lÃ¢Â€Â™officialisation de la nouvelle est attendue pour plus tard cette annÃƒÂ©e, et il pourrait, lui aussi, commencer ÃƒÂ  jouer en 2017., 82780=Le classement est clairÃ‚Â : la domination du Mexique est sans partage. LogiqueÃ‚Â : depuis que la compÃƒÂ©tition a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© rebaptisÃƒÂ©e et rÃƒÂ©organisÃƒÂ©e en 2008, les clubs ÃƒÂ©trangers sont rarement capables de bouter leurs adversaires mexicains hors de la Ligue des champions. En six ÃƒÂ©ditions, avec donc 24 ÃƒÂ©quipes ÃƒÂ  ÃƒÂ©liminer, ce nÃ¢Â€Â™est arrivÃƒÂ© que trois fois.Ã‚Â LÃ¢Â€Â™an dernier, les GuatÃƒÂ©maltÃƒÂ¨ques de XelajÃƒÂ¹ ont sorti Guadalajara lors de la phase de groupes, devenant les premiers ÃƒÂ  rÃƒÂ©aliser lÃ¢Â€Â™exploit. Il a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© rÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© en quart de finale par Seattle, qui a ÃƒÂ©liminÃƒÂ© Tigres UANL. Cette saison, les Costariciens dÃ¢Â€Â™Alajuelense ont ÃƒÂ©mergÃƒÂ© de leur groupe au dÃƒÂ©triment de lÃ¢Â€Â™America Mexico. Bonne nouvelle pour leurs adversairesÃ‚Â : aprÃƒÂ¨s avoir ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© intouchables pendant quatre ans, les clubs mexicains ne sont plus invincibles., 125729=CommenÃƒÂ§ons avec le duel de ce soir, opposant les ÃƒÂ‰tats-Unis au Mexique. Les deux nations se sont affrontÃƒÂ©es 62 fois au cours de lÃ¢Â€Â™histoire (chiffre tirÃƒÂ© du site de la Fifa, comme tous ceux de cet article), avec un net avantage pour le pays au sud de la frontiÃƒÂ¨re. Si les AmÃƒÂ©ricains ont remportÃƒÂ© la premiÃƒÂ¨re confrontation entre les deux pays en 1934, ils ont dÃƒÂ» attendre 1980 puis 1991 pour sÃ¢Â€Â™imposer une deuxiÃƒÂ¨me puis une troisiÃƒÂ¨me fois. Depuis, cÃ¢Â€Â™est beaucoup plus ÃƒÂ©quilibrÃƒÂ©Ã¢Â€Â¦ et plus chaud. En raison des rÃƒÂ©sultats serrÃƒÂ©s, mais aussi de divers incidentsÃ‚Â : des fautes grossiÃƒÂ¨res de Ramon Ramirez sur Alexi Lalas (1997, photo) et de Rafael Marquez sur Cobi Jones (2002), puis Landon Donovan accusÃƒÂ© par les Mexicains dÃ¢Â€Â™avoir urinÃƒÂ© sur un de leurs terrains lors dÃ¢Â€Â™un entraÃƒÂ®nement prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dent un duel entre les deux pays en 2003., 129619=Toujours est-il que dans un premier temps, lorsque ÃƒÂ§a compte, lÃ¢Â€Â™Uruguay domineÃ‚Â : la Celeste est championne olympique en 1928 (sacre le plus important de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©poque), obtientlÃ¢Â€Â™organisation de la Coupe du monde deux ans plus tard et sÃ¢Â€Â™y impose en finale contre lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentine. JusquÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©mergence du BrÃƒÂ©sil, les deux voisins dominent la scÃƒÂ¨ne footballistique en AmÃƒÂ©rique du Sud, remportant entre autres 17 des 20 premiÃƒÂ¨res ÃƒÂ©ditions de la Copa America. MÃƒÂªme si lÃ¢Â€Â™Uruguay sÃ¢Â€Â™adjuge un second titre mondial en 1950, lÃ¢Â€Â™Argentine prend le dessus ÃƒÂ  partir de la Seconde guerre mondiale. LÃ¢Â€Â™Albiceleste reste rÃƒÂ©guliÃƒÂ¨re, atteignant des sommets en remportant la Coupe du monde chez elle en 1978 puis au Mexique en 1986, battant au passage lÃ¢Â€Â™Uruguay en huitiÃƒÂ¨me de finale lors dÃ¢Â€Â™un match oÃƒÂ¹ sont exacerbÃƒÂ©es les caricatures que les deux nations font lÃ¢Â€Â™une de lÃ¢Â€Â™autre. Si lÃ¢Â€Â™Uruguay alterne les hauts et les bas selon les gÃƒÂ©nÃƒÂ©rations, cela nÃ¢Â€Â™empÃƒÂªche pas les nombreux duels entre les deux voisins dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂªtre toujours ÃƒÂ¢prement disputÃƒÂ©s, plus encore ces derniers temps avec deux ÃƒÂ©quipes parmi les meilleures au monde., 115788=Depuis le milieu des annÃƒÂ©es 1970, le Derby des plats pays est marquÃƒÂ© par de chaudes luttes lors de matchs officiels. Ainsi, en 1973, un but belge ÃƒÂ  la derniÃƒÂ¨re minute est annulÃƒÂ© pour un hors-jeu tout sauf ÃƒÂ©vident, ce qui permet aux Bataves de se qualifier pour la Coupe du monde 1974 (dont ils termineront deuxiÃƒÂ¨mes). Les supporters de Portland se souviennent peut-ÃƒÂªtre du NÃƒÂ©erlandais Robbie Rensenbrink, qui jouait ÃƒÂ  Anderlecht lorsquÃ¢Â€Â™il a marquÃƒÂ© trois buts lors dÃ¢Â€Â™une victoire 5-0 des siens en 1975. Les Diables rouges se vengeront par la suite, en ÃƒÂ©cartant leurs voisins de la Coupe du monde 1982, mais surtout de lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©dition 1986 suite ÃƒÂ  un test-match (ÃƒÂ©quivalent des barrages dÃ¢Â€Â™aujourdÃ¢Â€Â™hui) et seront demi-finalistes du Mundial mexicain. Les deux pays se sont affrontÃƒÂ©s deux fois en phase finale de Coupe du mondeÃ‚Â : un partage 0-0 en France en 1998, et une victoire belge 1-0 ÃƒÂ  Orlando en 1994., 117645=Les deux puissances actuelles du soccer asiatique, la CorÃƒÂ©e du Sud et le Japon, ont un important contentieux historique. Et pour causeÃ‚Â : la premiÃƒÂ¨re a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© annexÃƒÂ©e par le second entre le dÃƒÂ©but du XXe siÃƒÂ¨cle et la fin de la Seconde guerre mondiale, avec peu dÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©gards pour ses habitants et leur culture ainsi quÃ¢Â€Â™une forte rÃƒÂ©pression. CÃ¢Â€Â™est donc dans un contexte dÃ¢Â€Â™extrÃƒÂªme tension quÃ¢Â€Â™a lieu leur premiÃƒÂ¨re rencontre sur un terrain de soccer en 1954. Le prÃƒÂ©sident corÃƒÂ©en ne voulant pas voir de Japonais sur son territoire, il demande ÃƒÂ  ses joueurs de disputer les deux duels prÃƒÂ©vus sur le terrain ennemiÃ¢Â€Â¦ et prÃƒÂ©vient quÃ¢Â€Â™il les jettera ÃƒÂ  lÃ¢Â€Â™eau sÃ¢Â€Â™ils ne reviennent pas en vainqueurs. Ils ÃƒÂ©chappent ÃƒÂ  la noyade avec une victoire et un partage. Il faut attendre 1960 pour voir les deux pays sÃ¢Â€Â™affronter ÃƒÂ  SÃƒÂ©oul. CÃ¢Â€Â™est aussi une des rares pÃƒÂ©riodes oÃƒÂ¹ le Japon rivalise avec son adversaire avant lÃ¢Â€Â™ÃƒÂ©mergence de la J-League, crÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ©e en 1993. Le bilan actuel de ce match baptisÃƒÂ© Haniljeon est de 34 victoires corÃƒÂ©ennes, 12 japonaises et 20 nuls. Les tensions se sont amenuisÃƒÂ©es, comme en tÃƒÂ©moigne lÃ¢Â€Â™organisation commune de la Coupe du monde 2002Ã¢Â€Â¦ marquÃƒÂ©e par une rivalitÃƒÂ© telle que mÃƒÂªme les pontes de la Fifa reconnaissaient le manque de collaboration entre les comitÃƒÂ©s organisateurs des deux paysÃ‚Â ! La rancÃ…Â“ur est tenace et il a fallu attendre le dÃƒÂ©but du siÃƒÂ¨cle pour que la culture japonaise ait ÃƒÂ  nouveau droit de citÃƒÂ© en CorÃƒÂ©e du Sud.}",

Roads were closed that evening as ice built up over the county. Businesses, city and county offices, and schools remained closed through January 16. Event Narrative Cold air poured into South Central Texas on January 14 and 15 in the wake of a strong cold front, with temperatures ranging from the mid 30s to just below freezing early on the morning of January 15. At the same time, an upper level disturbance began to approach South Texas from the southwest. Light precipitation from the upper level system began falling through the cold air and freezing over the northwest counties first. With time, the event spread to the west and southeast, including all but the extreme southern tier of counties, by January 16. Spotty 1 to 2 inch snowfalls were common over the Hill Country and Edwards Plateau. The serious problems were associated with coatings of freezing rain and drizzle that varied from one-half inch to three-quarters of an inch in thickness. In many locations, schools and businesses and local offices were already closed on January 15 due to the Martin Luther King Holiday and simply did not re-open",Privacy Policy | FOIA | Information Quality | Disclaimer | Contact Us,False,-1,0,,,

The incidence of neonatal sepsis has declined, but mortality remains high. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) possess a broad spectrum of activity modulating coagulation and inflammation. In septic adults it may reduce mortality, but no significant benefit has been reported in children with severe sepsis. Objectives To determine whether treatment with rhAPC reduces mortality and/or morbidity in neonatal sepsis.

Doctoral dissertations, theses and the Science Citation Index for articles on activated protein C were searched. No language restriction was applied. Selection criteria Randomized or quasi-randomized trials, assessing the efficacy of rhAPC compared to placebo or no intervention as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy of suspected or confirmed severe sepsis in term and preterm infants less than 28 days old.

The significantly higher risk of intracranial haemorrhage in this population and the lack of efficacy in the pediatric population tilts the balance significantly toward an adverse risk compared to any potential benefit ratio. Currently there is no evidence that it is beneficial in newborn infants. In the interim, focus should be on the prevention of sepsis with simple, cost effective and easy to practice established strategies like hand hygiene, strict adherence to sterile, aseptic techniques during procedures, early introduction of enteral feeding and optimal parenteral nutrition. Within the context of randomized controlled trials, the use of adjunctive treatments should still be explored and is justified in severe early onset sepsis and cases of nosocomial sepsis occurring in spite of preventive measures., 78355=Ohlsson A, Lacy JB.

Six hours after the start of therapy, coagulation parameters returned to normal. Apart from pyloric stenosis surgery at five weeks, the infant had a normal recovery (Rawicz 2002). There are case reports of a four day old 35 week gestational age neonate with severe Group B streptococcal sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction, who was treated with rhAPC and had an uneventful recovery (Strohler 2004) and its use in a teenage girl with sepsis (Manco-Johnson 2004). Sajan et al describes use of rhAPC in a four month old infant weighing 3500 g with Gram negative septic shock with Serratia Marcescens. This patient had no apparent adverse effects during rhAPC infusion and recovered, but had transient systemic hypertension and incidental detection of bilateral small occipital hemorrhages 22 days after infusion (Sajan 2004). Wyss reports retrospective data of six open label reports of rhAPC use in children (newborn to 18 years). Details of the number of subjects less than 28 days and their outcomes are awaited (Wyss 2004). There was a case series of the use of rhAPC in three children outside the neonatal age group with meningococcal purpura fulminans, two of whom survived without any adverse effects (Martinon-Torres 2004). A 12 day old neonate with group B Streptococcal septic shock was treated with 24 micrograms/kg of rhAPC for 96 hours and the infant recovered without any adverse effects (Frommhold 2005). There is a report of a seven year old girl with peritonitis, septic shock and multiorgan failure, treated successfully with DrotAA (Verre 2005)., 5604=Sepsis (a generalized blood stream infection) is common in neonates. Severe sepsis carries a high mortality and morbidity even with current critical care management. Activated Protein C (APC) is a protein formed within the human body to prevent formation of blood clots and helps in breaking down clots. Recombinant human APC (rhAPC) is a synthesized version of APC using recombinant technology. It has been shown to reduce mortality in severe sepsis in adults. The review authors investigated whether treatment of severe sepsis in newborn infants with rhAPC will help to reduce mortality and severe morbidity. The review authors found no controlled studies in this age group. On October 25, 2011 rhAPC (XigrisÃ‚Â®) was withdrawn from the market by Eli Lilly due to side effect in adults. RhAPC should no longer be used in any age category and the product should be returned to the distributor., 1359=Search updated in May 2011., 23597=Additionally we searched abstracts of proceedings of Pediatric Academic Societies (American Pediatric Society, Society for Pediatric Research) and European Society for Paediatric Research (1990 to 2011), the database of dissertation abstracts, relevant doctoral theses and dissertations, conference and symposia proceedings, the bibliography of selected articles and journal hand searching in the English Language.

The study enrolled 477 patients, 237 received placebo and 240 received Drotrecogin alfa ( activated) rhAPC, but two patients in the placebo and one patient in the DrotAA group did not complete the study. There was no difference in the 28 day all-cause mortality [17.2% (41/239 )] in the DrotAA group and [17.5% (41/235)] in the placebo group with a relative risk of 1.06 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.46 ) for Drot AA compared with placebo. There was no difference in the primary endpoint, which was the composite time to complete organ failure resolution (CFTOR). Of note, the incidence of central nervous system bleeding in the DrotAA group was 4.6% ( 11 patients ) compared to 2.1% (5 patients) in the placebo group (p = 0.13) (Nadel 2007)., 58040=Albuali WH, Singh RN, Fraser DD, Scott LA, Kornecki A.

RhAPC has been approved for use in the USA and EU and is currently indicated for the reduction of mortality in adults with severe sepsis who are at high risk for death with multiple dysfunctional organs or high APACHE II scores (Knaus 1985; Manns 2002; FDA 2002; EMEA 2002; Bernard 2004).

Neonates have a higher mortality for sepsis than older children or adults, and hence is likely to show more benefit to an advantageous therapy. There are several case reports and trials of rhAPC use in severe sepsis in children and neonates with apparent clinical benefit (Rawicz 2002; Barton 2004; Sajan 2004; Strohler 2004; Parker 2005).

Subsequently other studies like RESOLVE (Nadel 2007), ADDRESS (Abraham 2005) and ENHANCE (Goldstein 2006) did not show any efficacy and in fact the risk of bleeding was increased. A retrospective study in adults showed that the risk of serious bleeding was seen in 35% patients receiving rhAPC (XigrisÃ‚Â®) compared to 3.8% (Gentry 2009). Due to numerous concerns being raised (Eichacker 2003; Sweeney 2009), a larger randomized controlled trial was planned with the study protocol well published prior to the conduct of the study (Finfer 2008; PROWESS SHOCK Steering Committee 2010; Ranieri 2011). This PROWESS-SHOCK clinical trial is yet to be published, but it failed to show a survival benefit. In this trial of 1696 patients, 851 patients were enrolled in the XigrisÃ‚Â® arm and 845 patients were enrolled in the placebo arm.

The significantly higher risk of intracranial haemorrhage in this population and the lack of efficacy in the pediatric population tilts the balance significantly toward an adverse risk compared to any potential benefit ratio. Currently there is no evidence that it is beneficial in newborn infants. In the interim, focus should be on the prevention of sepsis with simple, cost effective and easy to practice established strategies like hand hygiene, strict adherence to sterile, aseptic techniques during procedures, early introduction of enteral feeding and optimal parenteral nutrition. Within the context of randomized controlled trials, the use of adjunctive treatments should still be explored and is justified in severe early onset sepsis and cases of nosocomial sepsis occurring in spite of preventive measures., 78355=Ohlsson A, Lacy JB.

Critical Care Medicine 2003;31:1250-6., 32910=Rawicz described the use of rhAPC in a full term neonate weighing 2750 g with early onset enterococcal sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Six hours after the start of therapy, coagulation parameters returned to normal. Apart from pyloric stenosis surgery at five weeks, the infant had a normal recovery (Rawicz 2002). There are case reports of a four day old 35 week gestational age neonate with severe Group B streptococcal sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction, who was treated with rhAPC and had an uneventful recovery (Strohler 2004) and its use in a teenage girl with sepsis (Manco-Johnson 2004). Sajan et al describes use of rhAPC in a four month old infant weighing 3500 g with Gram negative septic shock with Serratia Marcescens. This patient had no apparent adverse effects during rhAPC infusion and recovered, but had transient systemic hypertension and incidental detection of bilateral small occipital hemorrhages 22 days after infusion (Sajan 2004). Wyss reports retrospective data of six open label reports of rhAPC use in children (newborn to 18 years). Details of the number of subjects less than 28 days and their outcomes are awaited (Wyss 2004). There was a case series of the use of rhAPC in three children outside the neonatal age group with meningococcal purpura fulminans, two of whom survived without any adverse effects (Martinon-Torres 2004). A 12 day old neonate with group B Streptococcal septic shock was treated with 24 micrograms/kg of rhAPC for 96 hours and the infant recovered without any adverse effects (Frommhold 2005). There is a report of a seven year old girl with peritonitis, septic shock and multiorgan failure, treated successfully with DrotAA (Verre 2005)., 5604=Sepsis (a generalized blood stream infection) is common in neonates. Severe sepsis carries a high mortality and morbidity even with current critical care management. Activated Protein C (APC) is a protein formed within the human body to prevent formation of blood clots and helps in breaking down clots. Recombinant human APC (rhAPC) is a synthesized version of APC using recombinant technology. It has been shown to reduce mortality in severe sepsis in adults. The review authors investigated whether treatment of severe sepsis in newborn infants with rhAPC will help to reduce mortality and severe morbidity. The review authors found no controlled studies in this age group. On October 25, 2011 rhAPC (XigrisÃ‚Â®) was withdrawn from the market by Eli Lilly due to side effect in adults. RhAPC should no longer be used in any age category and the product should be returned to the distributor., 1359=Search updated in May 2011., 23597=Additionally we searched abstracts of proceedings of Pediatric Academic Societies (American Pediatric Society, Society for Pediatric Research) and European Society for Paediatric Research (1990 to 2011), the database of dissertation abstracts, relevant doctoral theses and dissertations, conference and symposia proceedings, the bibliography of selected articles and journal hand searching in the English Language.

The study enrolled 477 patients, 237 received placebo and 240 received Drotrecogin alfa ( activated) rhAPC, but two patients in the placebo and one patient in the DrotAA group did not complete the study. There was no difference in the 28 day all-cause mortality [17.2% (41/239 )] in the DrotAA group and [17.5% (41/235)] in the placebo group with a relative risk of 1.06 (95% CI 0.66 to 1.46 ) for Drot AA compared with placebo. There was no difference in the primary endpoint, which was the composite time to complete organ failure resolution (CFTOR). Of note, the incidence of central nervous system bleeding in the DrotAA group was 4.6% ( 11 patients ) compared to 2.1% (5 patients) in the placebo group (p = 0.13) (Nadel 2007)., 58040=Albuali WH, Singh RN, Fraser DD, Scott LA, Kornecki A.

Risks and benefits of activated protein C treatment for severe sepsis. New England Journal of Medicine 2002;347:1027-30., 13313=Although a variety of scales have been used to assess severity and predict risk [some incorporating organ dysfunction, such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) in adults, Pediatric Index of Mortality (PIM) and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III (PRISM III) in children and Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) and Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology II (SNAP II) in neonates], there are no easy to use, standardised scales (Knaus 1985; Network 1993; Vincent 1996; Pollack 1996; Shann 1997; Richardson 2001; Goldstein 2005). RhAPC has been approved for use in the USA and EU and is currently indicated for the reduction of mortality in adults with severe sepsis who are at high risk for death with multiple dysfunctional organs or high APACHE II scores (Knaus 1985; Manns 2002; FDA 2002; EMEA 2002; Bernard 2004). The Surviving Sepsis Committee has recommended use of rhAPC for the management of severe sepsis in adults. (Carcillo 2002; Carcillo 2003; Dellinger 2004; Parker 2004; Parker 2005; Dellinger 2008). Neonates have a higher mortality for sepsis than older children or adults, and hence is likely to show more benefit to an advantageous therapy. There are several case reports and trials of rhAPC use in severe sepsis in children and neonates with apparent clinical benefit (Rawicz 2002; Barton 2004; Sajan 2004; Strohler 2004; Parker 2005).

New England Journal of Medicine 2005;353:1332-41., 47172=The first randomized controlled trial in adults, PROWESS, was stopped early for efficacy (Bernard 2001). Subsequently other studies like RESOLVE (Nadel 2007), ADDRESS (Abraham 2005) and ENHANCE (Goldstein 2006) did not show any efficacy and in fact the risk of bleeding was increased. A retrospective study in adults showed that the risk of serious bleeding was seen in 35% patients receiving rhAPC (XigrisÃ‚Â®) compared to 3.8% (Gentry 2009). Due to numerous concerns being raised (Eichacker 2003; Sweeney 2009), a larger randomized controlled trial was planned with the study protocol well published prior to the conduct of the study (Finfer 2008; PROWESS SHOCK Steering Committee 2010; Ranieri 2011). This PROWESS-SHOCK clinical trial is yet to be published, but it failed to show a survival benefit. In this trial of 1696 patients, 851 patients were enrolled in the XigrisÃ‚Â® arm and 845 patients were enrolled in the placebo arm. The preliminary analyses done by Eli Lilly, that were submitted to the FDA, showed a 28-day all cause mortality rate of 26.4% (223/846) in XigrisÃ‚Â®-treated patients compared to 24.2% (202/834) in placebo-treated patients, for a relative risk of 1.09; 95% CI (0.92, 1.28), and P-value = 0.31 (not statistically significant) (FDA 2011a)., 82718=Stoll BJ, Hansen NI, Adams-Chapman I, Fanaroff AA, Hintz SR, Vohr B, Higgins RD; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network.

Lydbildet er ""modernisert"", noe som gjÃƒÂ¸r at disse versjonene hÃƒÂ¸res friskere og bedre ut enn originalmiksene., 227889=Da de rÃƒÂ¸de og blÃƒÂ¥ samlealbumene utkom i 1973, var det forskjell pÃƒÂ¥ innholdet i USA-versjonene og UK-versjonene: I UK var alle sangene (minus Love Me Do) i stereo, I USA var fÃƒÂ¸lgende i mono: Love Me Do, I Want To Hold Your Hand, A Hard DayÃ‚Â’s Night, I Feel Fine, Ticket To Ride, Penny Lane og Hello Goodbye. I tillegg var Ã‚Â”James Bond ThemeÃ‚Â” inkludert (foran Help!) pÃƒÂ¥ det rÃƒÂ¸de dobbeltalbumet i USA., 87918=mens stereoversjonen stopper allerede etter 2:02, 86667=monoversjonen varer i 2:11, 8561=Ã‚Â”HELP!Ã‚Â”,Ã‚Â”RUBBER SOULÃ‚Â” og Ã‚Â”THE BEATLES 1962-1966 (Red Album)Ã‚Â”: CD-utgavene og senere vinyl- og kassett-utgaver av disse inneholder andre mikser enn pÃƒÂ¥ originalplatene. Skal du ha disse LPÃ‚Â’ene slik de opprinnelig lÃƒÂ¸d i stereo, mÃƒÂ¥ du altsÃƒÂ¥ skaffe deg disse LPÃ‚Â’ene (eller kassettene) i utgaver som er presset fÃƒÂ¸r 1987., 7166=Ã‚Â”THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGYÃ‚Â”. Tre dobbelt-CDÃ‚Â’er fra 1995-96, inneholder kun alternative versjoner av kjente lÃƒÂ¥ter, samt tidligere uutgitte sanger. Ingen av disse er tatt med i denne artikkelen., 10693=Platetitler: BB = The Beatles Beat,BFS= Beatles For Sale,BG = BeatlesÃ‚Â’ Greatest, BLUE = The Beatles 1967-1970 (Blue album), CBO = A Collection Of Beatles Oldies, H = Help!, HDN = A Hard DayÃ‚Â’s Night, IMA = Imagine: John Lennon (Soundtrack-LP), LIB = Let It Be, MMT = Magical Mystery Tour, PM = Past Masters, PPM = Please Please Me, R = Revolver, RAR = Rarities, RED = The Beatles 1962-1966 (Red Album), RM = Reel Music, RS = Rubber Soul, SA = Second Album, SGT = Sgt.

Et konsertopptak i uhyre dÃƒÂ¥rlig kvalitet som kom ut i 1977, hvor vi fÃƒÂ¥r konsertversjoner av fÃƒÂ¸lgende tidligere utgitte Beatles-sanger: I Saw Her Standing There, Roll Over Beethoven, Twist And Shout, Mr. Moonlight, A Taste Of Honey, Kansas City Ã‚Â– Hey Hey Hey Hey, Till There Was You, Ask Me Why, EverybodyÃ‚Â’s Trying To Be My Baby, Matchbox og Long Tall Sally. Ellers finner vi her ogsÃƒÂ¥ konsertversjoner av lÃƒÂ¥ter fra Ã‚Â”The Complete Silver BeatlesÃ‚Â” og Ã‚Â”Live At The BBCÃ‚Â”., 4623=Ã‚Â”THE BEATLES FIRST FEATURING TONY SHERIDANÃ‚Â”. Det finnes to versjoner av lÃƒÂ¥ta Ã‚Â”Sweet Georgia BrownÃ‚Â”, en versjon hvor Beatles er nevnt i teksten ble innspilt i 1964, da Tony Sheridan la pÃƒÂ¥ ny vokal pÃƒÂ¥ lÃƒÂ¥ta. Det er denne som er mest utbredt. Skal du ha lÃƒÂ¥ta med originaltekst, mÃƒÂ¥ du kjÃƒÂ¸pe den tyske EPÃ‚Â’en Ã‚Â”Ya YaÃ‚Â” (Polydor EPH 21485) fra 1961, den svenske samle-EPÃ‚Â’en Ã‚Â”volume 4Ã‚Â” (Polydor 2230 114) fra 1982, boka ""From Cavern to Star Club m/ gratis EP (1998), eller en bootleg hvor denne versjonen er med (f.eks. Ã‚Â”Yesterday MedleyÃ‚Â”). PÃƒÂ¥ de tre sistnevnte platene finner du dessuten en annen raritet fra Sheridan-opptakene: Ã‚Â”My BonnieÃ‚Â” med tysk og engelsk langsom intro. PÃƒÂ¥ den originale tyske Ã‚Â”My BonnieÃ‚Â”-singlen sang nemlig Tony fÃƒÂ¸rste vers (det langsomme) pÃƒÂ¥ tysk, og i England kom singlen ut med engelsk intro. Senere utgivelser har som regel bare slÃƒÂ¸yfet denne introen., 5608=Ã‚Â”THE COMPLETE SILVER BEATLESÃ‚Â”. Dette er demoteipen Beatles spilte inn for Decca 1. januar 1962.
