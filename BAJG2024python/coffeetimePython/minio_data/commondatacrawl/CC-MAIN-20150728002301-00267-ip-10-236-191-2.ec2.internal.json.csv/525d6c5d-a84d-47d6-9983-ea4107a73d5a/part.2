This is because the reported jobless rate hides more than it reveals. For starters, let√¢¬Ä¬ôs recall that last month√¢¬Ä¬ôs reported rate of unemployment was 7.8%. This was 0.3 points lower than in August and the lowest since the beginning of 2009. However, it was still a whopping three percentage points higher than the average rate posted in 2007. PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. (MarketWatch) √¢¬Ä¬î If you want to know just how bad the labor market really is, then you need to multiply September√¢¬Ä¬ôs jobless rate by three. Chief economist IrwinKellner By window.videoDomain = 'http://video-api.wsj.com';","For one thing, the unemployment rate does not take into account discouraged workers. These are people who have stopped looking for work because they have been unemployed for so long, they√¢¬Ä¬ôve given up. However, they would gladly take a job if one were offered. In addition, those who have remained on the jobless rolls for over six months, the long-term unemployed, now make up 40% of the jobless. This is the highest percentage in over 60 years. Then there are those who are working part-time but would prefer full-time employment. Others are employed as temps (without such benefits as health insurance, sick days, and so on) although they would rather have a permanent position. Finally, in today√¢¬Ä¬ôs economy, it is necessary to take into account the fact that many folks are working beneath their education or skill levels √¢¬Ä¬î for example, the former manager who now works as a clerk. Add up all these categories and the √¢¬Ä¬útrue√¢¬Ä? jobless rate is close to 25%. And when you consider that people are losing their jobs every day, even as others find work, you will find that as many as half of all households are being affected by the weak labor market each year.

This treatment is also called viscosupplementation. After an injection, some people may experience pain or swelling. Why It Is Used Doctors use hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) to treat osteoarthritis of the knee that has not improved with other treatment (such as acetaminophen and physical therapy). How Well It Works Results of some studies have shown that hyaluronan injections have improved the symptoms of osteoarthritis and joint function in some people. But a large analysis of many trials shows that any benefit from these injections is very small.footnote 1 Hylan may have more risk of increased symptoms or fluid in the joint after injection, and it does not appear to work better than other hyaluronan products.footnote 2 Side Effects All medicines have side effects.

Following a thorough review, two options were selected for further analysis. The company wanted to investigate recuperative and regenerative thermal oxidation. Reviewing the Options. The challenge was to find a technology that increased the vent rate approximately 11,000 cfm without costing more to operate than the smaller existing thermal oxidizer. Other issues, such as equipment size and weight, lead time and proven ability to treat the highly resinous exhaust from the oven, were crucial in the evaluation. The goal was to reduce the cost of operating the thermal oxidizer, which was exhausting approximately 5,000 cfm at 900F. Also, production personnel wanted to increase the exhaust flow rate by venting a canopy between the electrocoating tank and the oven to the oxidizer. This would eliminate fume spill-out from the entry end of the oven. In late 1992, TABC noticed that its four-year-old thermal oxidizer was showing signs of structural failure. An inspection determined that even with temporary repairs, the unit would probably only last six to 12 months. Rather than look at replacing the oxidizer with a similar unit, the company decided to investigate all the options available. Controlling VOCs emitted during curing the electrocoat primer is always challenging. When a freshly painted truck bed leaves the electrocoating tank and enters the curing oven, a combination of unreacted resins, coalescing solvents and high-molecular-weight organics are exposed to the oven's high temperature. This results","While the existing recuperative oxidizer was effectively destroying the electrocoating oven fumes, the relatively high operating cost was a concern. This was particularly true since TABC wished to increase its exhaust rate. Regenerative thermal oxidation offered low operating costs, primarily due to the high (95 pct) thermal energy recovery possible.

The skid-mounted CTO unit is shop built to minimize field erection time. Because of its weight, the unit was located at grade level beside the paint shop. Figure 1 shows an isometric view of the three ceramic-filled chambers in the unit. VOC-laden air enters the bottom of one of the chambers and is preheated as it flows upward through the hot ceramic bed. The burner at the top of the chamber adds additional heat to oxidize organic materials into carbon dioxide and water vapor. The clean hot gases exit through one of the adjacent chambers and transfer heat to that ceramic bed before release to atmosphere. After a certain time, the cycle is reversed so that inlet and outlet chambers switch to outlet and inlet cycles. At any given time, one of the three towers is purged. In this process, clean air is vented through a tower, pushing any unburned hydrocarbons through the burner prior to that tower's switching to an outlet cycle. This ensures that no unburned solvents are vented to the atmosphere. This process is responsible for the high thermal efficiency of the regenerative oxidizer. The unit is vented through an exhaust fan located downstream. An Allen-Bradley 1336VT 125-hp drive is used to maintain flow and air balance in the electrocoat oven, guaranteeing ventilation of the solvent and smoke from the oven through a signal from a pressure transducer",True,0,0,"{1423=In late 1992, TABC noticed that its four-year-old thermal oxidizer was showing signs of structural failure.

The good news is that Massachusetts has a lower-than-normal unemployment rate. Given their low unemployment, but higher cost of living, Massachusetts ranks about average overall for economy. It ranks #21 out of the 50 states for overall economy. Massachusetts is a good place to get a start for phlebotomy. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs a bit easier to find a job here. As healthcare needs continue to grow, using phlebotomy as a starting point looks better each year. The chart below graphs the upward trends of phlebotomy jobs in the United States.

Insurance coverage becomes more expensive with age. People often choose to buy term insurance since it is the least expensive and easiest to understand form of life insurance. Many term insurance policies offer conversion privileges that allow a policyholder to guarantee their insurability and convert to permanent insurance at a later","Probability of Living to Age: GUL Cumulative Premiums 84 50% $216,874 91 20% $243,430 96 5% $269,986 If permanent coverage is needed and the policy is held until mortality, buying permanent coverage now will be the least expensive option for securing $1 million of life insurance if the insured lives to median life expectancy or beyond. Buy term and convert to permanent alternative Instead of purchasing the GUL policy at age 35, the insured could choose to buy convertible term insurance for a period of 10, 20 or 30 years with the intent of converting to permanent insurance at the end of the term period. Annual term insurance premiums from the same insured are listed below. Term Period Annual Term Premiums 10 $505 20 $805 30 $1,105 As you can see, the annual term insurance premiums shown above are significantly less expensive than the GUL premiums of $4,426 per year. However, the cost of a GUL policy becomes much higher and more costly as an insured ages and when it becomes time to convert the 10, 20 or 30 year term insurance policy to permanent coverage.",True,0,0,"{6564=Joined: March 12, 2011}"

Shutter windows and secure outside doors. If shutters are not available, close window blinds, shades or curtains. Remember, rubber-soled shoes and rubber tires provide NO protection from lightning. However, the steel frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased protection if you are not touching metal. Get inside a home, building, or hard top automobile (not a convertible). Although you may be injured if lightning strikes your car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than outside. Secure outdoor objects that could blow away or cause damage. Postpone outdoor activities. Remove dead or rotting trees and branches that could fall and cause injury or damage during a severe thunderstorm. To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.

Some of the most severe occur when a single thunderstorm affects one location for an extended time. Thunderstorms typically produce heavy rain for a brief period, anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.

Ordering part number and feature code Back to top Did you know? Installing a Broadcom 10 Gb 4-port Gen 2 Ethernet Expansion Card to every blade server in a BladeCenter H chassis, plus the addition of four High-Speed I/O Modules, allows up to 40 Gbps of Ethernet bandwidth to every server in the chassis. This has the potential of meeting even the most bandwidth-intensive application needs, such as virtualization. The adapter connects to the midplane directly, without having to use cables or SFP modules. By eliminating these components for up to 14 servers, the resulting savings alone cover the BladeCenter chassis investment. Back to top Introduction IBM is committed to offering both function and flexibility to our clients through our products. IBM BladeCenter was the first to offer end-to-end 10 Gb Ethernet in a blade server configuration, and these expansion cards are part of that offering. IBM offers two new versions of the card, 2-port and 4-port, both based on the new Broadcom 57711 controller. The existing cards, based on the proven Broadcom 57710 module, will continue to be available to support customers who want to maintain a consistent hardware configuration.

In connection with such borrowings, the Fund may be required to maintain minimum average balances with the lender or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit. Any such requirements will increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest rate. Any such borrowings would be subject to the limits imposed by the 1940 Act, which generally limits the principal amount represented by such Indebtedness to 331/3% of the value of RXF√Ç¬ís total assets less liabilities. In addition, agreements related to such borrowings may also impose certain requirements, which may be more stringent than those imposed by the 1940 Act.

If RXF fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, and the statutory relief provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the √Ç¬ìCode√Ç¬î), do not apply, RXF will be subject to income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate rates, without allowance of a deduction for dividends paid. This could substantially reduce funds available for RXF to distribute to its shareholders. The failure of any Selected REIT, or any other company in which RXF invests and which purports to be a REIT, to qualify as a REIT could have an adverse effect on RXF√Ç¬ís ability to satisfy the income, asset and other requirements that RXF must satisfy in order to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year., 623343=0.2932, 977612=Under the 1940 Act, a √Ç¬ìsenior security√Ç¬î does not include any promissory note or evidence of indebtedness where such loan is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of total assets of the issuer at the time the loan is made., 980656=(d)√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬†√Ç¬† purchase or sell commodities or commodity futures contracts or commodity options except as permitted by (i)√Ç¬†the 1940 Act, or interpretations or modifications by the SEC, SEC staff or other authority with appropriate jurisdiction, or (ii)√Ç¬†exemptive or other relief or permission from the SEC, SEC staff or other authority;, 783977=Under the 1940 Act, RXF generally is not permitted to issue Indebtedness unless, immediately after the Indebtedness the principal amount represented by Indebtedness is 331/3% of the value of RXF√Ç¬ís total assets less liabilities. Similarly, RXF generally is not permitted to declare any cash dividend or other distribution on the RXF Common Shares unless, at the time of such declaration other than the principal amount represented by Indebtedness is at least 331/3% of the value of RXF√Ç¬ís total assets, less liabilities after deducting the amount of such dividend or other distribution. If RXF utilizes Indebtedness, RXF intends, to the extent possible, to prepay all or a portion of the principal amount of any outstanding Indebtedness to the extent necessary to maintain the required asset coverage. RXF may also utilize Indebtedness in excess of such limit for temporary purposes such as the settlement of transactions., 733469=Shares in Selected REITs tendered in the Exchange Offers may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Date.

With respect to this restriction, the 1940 Act does not prohibit a fund from making loans; however SEC staff interpretations currently prohibit funds from lending more than one-third of their total assets, except through the purchase of debt obligations or the use of repurchase agreements. A repurchase agreement is an agreement to purchase a security, coupled with an agreement to sell a security back to the original seller on an agreed upon date at a price that reflects current interest rates. The SEC frequently treats repurchase agreements as loans., 1089051=RXF and the Adviser have adopted a code of ethics under Rule√Ç¬†17j-1 of the 1940 Act, which is applicable to officers, directors, and designated employees of RXF and the Adviser. Employees of RXF and the Adviser are permitted to make personal securities transactions, including transactions in securities that the Fund may purchase, sell or hold, subject to requirements and restrictions set forth in the code of ethics. The code of ethics contains provisions and requirements designed to identify and address certain conflicts of interest between personal investment activities of both RXF√Ç¬ís and the Adviser√Ç¬ís employees and the interests of investment advisory clients such as RXF. Among other things, the code of ethics prohibits certain types of transactions absent prior approval, imposes time periods during which duplicate broker confirmations and statements and quarterly reporting of securities transactions are required. Additional restrictions apply to certain personnel that may include portfolio managers, traders, research analysts and others involved in the investment advisory process. Exceptions to these and other provisions of the code of ethics may be granted in particular circumstances after review by appropriate personnel. The code of ethics can be reviewed and copied at the Commission√Ç¬ís public reference room in Washington, D.C.

The Dodd-Frank Act covers a broad range of topics, including, among many others: a reorganization of federal financial regulators; the creation of a process designed to ensure financial system stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms; the enactment of new rules for derivatives trading; the creation of a consumer financial protection watchdog; the regulation of rating agencies; and the enactment of new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans.

RXF may utilize Financial Leverage up to the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. So long as the net rate of return on RXF√Ç¬ís investments purchased with the proceeds of Financial Leverage exceeds the cost of such Financial Leverage, such excess amounts will be available to pay higher distributions to holders of RXF Common Shares. Under current market conditions, RXF initially expects to utilize Financial Leverage such that the aggregate amount of Financial Leverage is not expected to exceed 25% of RXF√Ç¬ís Managed Assets (including the proceeds of such Financial Leverage). There can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be implemented or that it will be successful during any period in which it might be employed., 305985=You should read this prospectus, which contains important information about RXF that you should know before deciding whether to exchange your shares, and retain it for future reference.

The typical temperature low for the year falls in January, in the dead of winter, when it gets down to 40√Ç¬∫ (Celsius or Fahrenheit, any way you look at it, that low and the temperature scales cross). The temperature high tends to fall in July, which can get up to the 80s (Fahrenheit) at the highest.

I find kale chips to be super quick to make so I often make a batch of kale chips on their own just for fun. Other than that, I generally only dehydrate on √¢¬Ä¬údehydrator days√¢¬Ä? to prepare in advance for the next week or two. In general, I suggest having two main √¢¬Ä¬údehydrator days√¢¬Ä? per month, and then if you wish to dehydrate some smaller batches for treats and snacks on the fly (ex. kale chips) in between your big dehydrator days you can go ahead and do so if your schedule and cravings permit! Sample Dehydrating Schedule If you come home from work and need to make a quick dinner, either you turn to dehydrated snacks/entrees that you have already made on a previous dehydrator day and stored/refrigerated, or else you have to look to other non-dehydrated options that night for dinner, for example, a nut pate, salad or a raw soup. It is not realistic to expect that there are any dehydrated recipes that can be whipped up from scratch and ready to eat in an hour or two. The idea is that you separate √¢¬Ä¬údehydrating√¢¬Ä? from preparing meals the same way that you separate grocery shopping from preparing meals. They are both connected, but they are not the same thing. For example, it is","The Rawtarian√¢¬Ä¬ôs Way: In general, I dehydrate 2-3 times per month using my 9-tray dehydrator. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs enough to keep me (raw family of 1) more than satisfied for one month, because I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt eat dehydrated foods for every meal. I usually make Sundays my √¢¬Ä¬údehydrator day√¢¬Ä? because I tend to stay home on Sundays. However, I do my grocery shopping in advance because I find it bothersome having to shop AND prepare food on the same day. I prepare the recipes and set them in the dehydrator first thing in the morning so that I can monitor my food√¢¬Ä¬ôs progress every few hours. I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt make a lot of sweet items in my dehydrator. When it comes to sweets I actually prefer many refrigerated/frozen recipes rather than dehydrated sweets. I usually use my dehydrator to make savory entrees and crackers and salty snacks, and I could not live without my savory dehydrated goodies! Whenever I√¢¬Ä¬ôm dehydrating a sweet bunch of recipes, I usually fill any extra empty dehydrator trays with dehydrated bananas. Also, once I√¢¬Ä¬ôve dehydrated a bunch of stuff I enjoy eating them pretty much every day for dinner until they are all consumed. After I run out, I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have dehydrated food for about a week or sometimes even",True,0,0,"{61520=√Ç¬© 2009-2015 The Rawtarian. ""The rest of the world lives to eat, while I eat to live.""}"

ISC Security Design Criteria Blast Protection Levels for Windows The GSA blast protection criteria has been adopted by the multi-agency Interagency Security Committee (ISC) and is the most widely recognized classification of design levels for glazing hazard protection. See Table 1. Threat/vulnerability assessments and risk analyses conducted for a project set the protective level requirements for glazing hazard mitigation. It should be noted that protective glazing measures would also be appropriate for buildings that are located near high risk targets, even though the building themselves are not considered a target. Collateral damage to buildings surrounding the A.P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City and the World Trade Center site illustrates this concern. C. Design Levels for Glazing Hazard Protection Wet Anchoring Systems: Depending on the protective design requirements of a given building envelope area and opening, retrofit projects will sometimes utilize a Structural Silicone Adhesive, or wet system, to connect the edge of security film that is applied to the interior surface of a window frame. Under blast conditions, the film retains glass fragments in a single sheet that is suspended in the frame by the adhesive bond. If installed properly, wet anchoring systems can both meet performance requirements and be a cost-effective application. The depth of the silicone penetration into the frame bite is critical for proper performance. Generally, at least √Ç¬Ω in. penetration is required to achieve protection. Mechanical Anchoring Systems: For new construction, these systems will capture the glazing","Fig. 3. ISC Security Design Criteria Performance Conditions for Windows D. Related Glazing Design and Integration Issues After establishing a project's initial security performance level and protective glazing requirements for each area at risk, protective systems are selected in concert with consideration of other design requirements. It is important to ensure appropriate products and systems integration in the total glazing design solution and to achieve the optimum of multiple design objectives. Related design concerns include: Integration of building and site design to achieve ""standoff"" distances (the distance between the building and vehicular or pedestrian traffic), thereby minimizing the need for hardening of building envelopes. Natural devices such as berms, hedges, and ponds can be used very effectively to achieve stand off distances. Consider the attributes of rigid versus flexible glazing protection concepts. Many structural consultants hold that highly deformable energy dissipating protective window systems that restrain the debris and control glass failure",True,1,0,

These can be the result of exterior or interior detonations, which produce reflected, incident, and possibly gas pressure loadings. The blast forces produced directly interact with the occupants causing injury or possibly death. Secondary Effects: Secondary effects include fragment and debris impacts. Heavy and/or high velocity fragments and debris interact with the occupants of the facility causing injury or possibly death. Tertiary Effects: Tertiary effects include loss of balance and subsequent impact of the person into his/her surroundings due to the passing blast wave or violent movement of a supporting structure. The debris generated, or the collapse of structures produced, during an explosive (blast) attack causes the majority of injuries and death in a bombing event. As an example, over 5,000 people were injured by flying glass and debris in the bombings of two American embassies in Africa in 1998. The types of injuries that occurred included deep lacerations, eye injuries, etc. Approximately 90 people were blinded in the attack on the U.S. embassy in Kenya.1 When designing window systems to resist blast forces it is important that the glazing, framing, and anchorage all be designed to withstand the required forces. Generally, the glazing should be the weak link (i.e., it is not desirable for the window system to prematurely fail",True,0,0,

The APR includes the interest rate, points, lender fees, and certain other financing charges the borrower is required to pay. Using APR to compare quotes is helpful because it takes into account both the interest rate and financing fees. The APR is calculated by Zillow.

I then compare to the debate of religion's adaptive status, showing that several new research questions arise in this way.

In addition the age that growth hormone treatment began in the PWS participants will be correlated with physical features, body composition, cognition, behavior, developmental milestones, pubertal issues, and the onset of nutritional phases. phenotypic assessments will include cognitive level, behavioral analysis, physical features including body measurements and composition, co-morbidities (skin picking, psychiatric history, seizures, autistic behavior) medications required, and further comparison with the underlying molecular diagnosis.","Detailed Description: PWS is a complex neurobehavioral syndrome. Clinical features include obesity, increased appetite, low muscle tone, cognitive impairment, distinct behavioral features, hypogonadism, and neonatal failure-to-thrive. It is the most commonly recognized genetic cause of obesity; however, many obese children do not in fact have PWS. These individuals are therefore diagnosed with EMO, a condition that shares features with PWS. The development of new advances and strategies for treating PWS and EMO requires a thorough understanding of the conditions at both the clinical and molecular levels. One goal of this study is to collect long-term data on individuals with PWS and EMO in order to gain a better understanding of the natural progression of the conditions, from the neonatal period well into adulthood. Specific to PWS, this study will establish a genotype-phenotype correlation among the different sub-types and will evaluate the effects of growth hormone treatment on disease progression. Lastly, the study will compare PWS with EMO in terms of clinical features and genetic basis. Participation in this natural history study will entail an initial evaluation, followed by yearly study visits until the age of 3 and then every 2 years thereafter. Each study visit will last between 3 and 4 hours, and will include a physical exam (including a DEXA scan to determine body composition), psychological testing, an interview with the study physician, and an evaluation of the participant's diet history.",True,0,0,

The incidence of pain in advanced stages of cancer approaches 70% to 80%. There are a number of reasons that patients with cancer experience chronic pain either related to the disease itself or to its treatment. Cancer can spread by metastasis or direct invasion, and 90% of patients with metastasis to osseous structures report pain. Patients with cancer can have neuropathic pain due to direct compression of nerves or plexus or spinal cord involvement. Inadequate treatment and undertreatment are associated with increased pain scores, decreased functional ability, and increased depression and anxiety. Opioid administration though proven to be effective still meets with resistance from both healthcare operators, who are seldom willing to prescribe these drugs, and patients, who tend to not take them because of many false beliefs still related to opioids. It is well demonstrated by the literature that opioids are effective in controlling both acute and chronic pain of nociceptive and/or neuropathic origin. Switching type of opioid and/or administration routes (e.g., from oral to neuraxial) is also known to be an important factor in long-term treatment: appropriate conversion tables elucidating drug equipotence and different potency in base of administration route for the different opioids currently available have therefore been devised and",True,0,0,

The Order of the Garter uses terminology different from that of most other British orders. 'Extra Knights Companion of the Garter' and 'Extra Ladies of the Order of the Garter' are the equivalent of 'Honorary Knights' and 'Honorary Dames' in other orders. As with other orders, the pre-nominal styles 'Sir' and 'Lady' are not used by Extra Knights and Extra Ladies. Revoked appointments are said to be 'degraded' rather than 'annulled'; the effect, however, is the same.

His knowledge of chords rivalled Coleman Hawkins, and, due to their similarity in tones, Byas can be considered an extension of the elder tenor. He played with many top swing bands, including those of Lionel Hampton (1935), Buck Clayton (1936), Don Redman, Lucky Millinder, Andy Kirk (1939-1940), and most importantly Count Basie (1941-1943)....

The collaboration was a long time in the making, as all three musicians had previously worked together in some capacity. Krug, also of Wolf Parade, had worked on and off with Mercer's Frog Eyes for years, and both musicians were former roommates. Meanwhile, Bejar called upon Frog Eyes to serve as his backing band for Destroyer's 2005 opus, Your Blues. Together, the musicians also recorded new versions of songs from Your Blues entitled Notorious Lightning and Other Works. Before 2005 came to a close, the three friends dismantled their temporary name, the Songwriters Project, and christened themselves Swan Lake. Their self-produced debut album, Beast Moans, arrived in November 2006 via the Jagjaguwar label. Enemy Mine followed in 2009, featuring a more collaborative approach to the bandmates' songwriting.}"

The theoretical-methodological basis of this work draws from critical cultural studies and sociological media research, specifically from the theoretical assumptions of critical discourse analysis about media representation. The premise is the constructionist view that the media does not directly reflect the reality of urban poverty, but constructs journalist reproductions of it from a particular perspective and in a certain social context. Media representation of the subordinated groups is related to the prevailing power relations and inequalities in society. The intention is to consider whether the discrimination and exclusion experienced by the urban poor is reproduced in media representations. The theme is approached by exploring how one specific poor urban neighborhood, the barrio √¢\x80\x9cEl 70√¢\x80? in Caracas, Venezuela, is represented in Venezuelan newspapers. The data consists of 57 newspaper articles about the barrio √¢\x80\x9cEl 70√¢\x80? from the years 2007-2010, of which 42 are collected from one of the largest national newspapers, El Universal, and the rest are collected by a community representative of √¢\x80\x9cEl 70√¢\x80? from different national and regional newspapers. The data is first described and classified through the means of content analysis. The principal analysis is conducted with the tools of critical discourse analysis, particularly those defined by Norman Fairclough. The analysis consists of power-focused textual analysis of the articles completed by socio-cultural interpretation of the results in the context of the case community and in the wider context of Venezuelan society. The aim is to study not only what kinds of representations are constructed of the case community and whether these are discriminatory, but also the potential effects of these representations and the possibilities of challenging them. The case community and its inhabitants are represented mostly through negative and stereotypical discourses that reduce them to their disadvantages, defined by insecurity, social exclusion and deficient living conditions. However, a strong positive discourse was also found related to organization and empowerment of the urban poor. Pieces of other counter-discourses challenging the negative representations were also identified. These varied representations reflect the prevailing power relations, but also the changes that have occurred in Venezuelan society during the last decade.', '200 s.', 'eng', 'This publication is copyrighted.

Issue Date: 2007 Publisher: Ohio State University Abstract: The jet cooled spectrum of pentafluoroethane (C$_2$HF$_5$) has been recorded between 1100. and 1325. \wn at a resolution of 0.0022 \wn. A rotational temperature of approximately 10 K was achieved by expanding 50 Torr of C$_2$HF$_5$ in 500 Torr of helium. Transitions belonging to five different vibrations have been assigned and fit to a Watson Hamiltonian: the \nub{3} at 1309.88 \wn, the \nub{4} at 1200.74 \wn, the \nub{5} at 1142.78 \wn, the \nub{13} at 1223.33 \wn, and the \nub{14} at 1147.39 \wn. The rms deviations of the fits of the \nub{4} band (0.0004 \wn) as well as the overlapping \nub{5} (0.0006 \wn) and \nub{14} (0.0004 \wn) bands are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental uncertainty.

Ma√Ö¬ædaug nuo 1520 m. Ticianas gyveno kartu su √Ñ¬åe√Ñ?ilija, jauna moterimi i√Ö¬° gimtojo Kador√Ñ¬ós kaimo. Jie susilauk√Ñ¬ó dviej√Ö¬≥ s√Ö¬´n√Ö¬≥: Pomponijo 1524 m. ir Oracijo 1525 m. Tais metais √Ñ¬åe√Ñ?ilija sunkiai susirgo ir Ticianas j√Ñ¬Ö ved√Ñ¬ó. Po to porai gim√Ñ¬ó dvi dukterys, i√Ö¬° kuri√Ö¬≥ Lavinija i√Ö¬°gyveno vaikyst√Ñ¬ô. √Ñ¬åe√Ñ?ilija mir√Ñ¬ó 1530 m. ir Ticianas daugiau nebeved√Ñ¬ó kitos moters. 1531 m. dailininkas √Ñ¬Øsigijo pra√Ö¬°matn√Ö¬≥ nam√Ñ¬Ö Venecijoje, kuriame gyveno iki gyvenimo pabaigos. Jo draugu ir gerb√Ñ¬óju tapo garsus to meto literatas Pjetras Aretinas., 11599=1545 m. Romoje Ticianas Alesandro Farnez√Ñ¬ós u√Ö¬æsakymu nutap√Ñ¬ó √¢¬Ä¬ûDanaj√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú, kuri tapo prototipu grupei v√Ñ¬ólesni√Ö¬≥ tos pa√Ñ?ios temos paveiksl√Ö¬≥. Darbo metu Tician√Ñ¬Ö Belvederio r√Ö¬´muose aplank√Ñ¬ó D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æas Vazaris ir Mikeland√Ö¬æelas. Jiems i√Ö¬°√Ñ¬ójus Mikeland√Ö¬æelas auk√Ö¬°tai √Ñ¬Øvertino Ticiano stili√Ö¬≥ ir spalv√Ö¬≥ valdym√Ñ¬Ö, ta√Ñ?iau apgail√Ñ¬ójo tai, kad Ticianas, kaip ir kiti Venecijos dailininkai, nesimok√Ñ¬ó tinkamai pie√Ö¬°imo technikos. I√Ö¬° Mikeland√Ö¬æelo √Ö¬æod√Ö¬æi√Ö¬≥ ir, grei√Ñ?iau, dar ir Vazario nuostatos, kilo savoti√Ö¬°kas mitas, kad Ticiano sugeb√Ñ¬ójimai valdyti linij√Ñ¬Ö buvo prasti. I√Ö¬° tikro i√Ö¬°lik√Ñ¬ô Ticiano pie√Ö¬°iniai rodo talenting√Ñ¬Ö pie√Ö¬°imo technik√Ñ¬Ö ir, kas i√Ö¬° tikro u√Ö¬ækliuvo D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æui Vazariui, tai venecijieti√Ö¬°kos dail√Ñ¬ós metodas, kur√Ñ¬Ø jis laik√Ñ¬ó ydingu. Ticianas drob√Ñ¬óje tik apmesdavo planuojamo paveikslo kont√Ö¬´rus raudona anglimi ar teptuku ir i√Ö¬°kart tapydavo da√Ö¬æais. Florentieti√Ö¬°kas metodas ap√Ñ¬óm√Ñ¬ó ypa√Ñ? kruop√Ö¬°t√Ö¬≥ b√Ö¬´sim√Ö¬≥ paveikslo fig√Ö¬´r√Ö¬≥ anatomin√Ñ¬ô ir judesio analiz√Ñ¬ô pie√Ö¬°iniuose, i√Ö¬° kuri√Ö¬≥ v√Ñ¬óliau buvo atrenkamas geriausiai vyk√Ñ¬ôs variantas. Tokiu b√Ö¬´du paveiksluose pavykdavo pasiekti auk√Ö¬°t√Ñ¬Ö idealistin√Ñ¬Ø fig√Ö¬´r√Ö¬≥ vaizdavim√Ñ¬Ö. Ticiano k√Ö¬´rybos √Ñ¬Øtaigum√Ñ¬Ö kaip tik didele dalimi lemia tapybos impulsyvumas, neu√Ö¬æbaigtumas, laisvi pot√Ñ¬ópiai, netgi ner√Ö¬´pestingas da√Ö¬æ√Ö¬≥ u√Ö¬æne√Ö¬°imas ant drob√Ñ¬ós. V√Ñ¬óliau Vazaris aplank√Ñ¬ó Tician√Ñ¬Ö jo dirbtuv√Ñ¬óje Venecijoje, kur rado dailinink√Ñ¬Ö, tapant√Ñ¬Ø da√Ö¬æus ant drob√Ñ¬ós tiesiog pir√Ö¬°tais., 33932=1520 m. Ticianas gavo u√Ö¬æsakym√Ñ¬Ö sukurti 5 dali√Ö¬≥ altoriaus paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö √¢¬Ä¬ûKristaus prisik√Ñ¬ólimas su √Ö¬†v. Nazarijumi ir Celsiu√¢¬Ä¬ú, kuris buvo u√Ö¬æsakytas popie√Ö¬æiaus legato Venecijoje vyskupo Altobello Averoldo. Paveikslas buvo skirtas Santi Nazaro e Celso ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?iai Bre√Ö¬°ijoje.[8] Jame Kristaus prisik√Ñ¬ólimas i√Ö¬° kapo vaizduojamas dar energingesniu nei Marijos kilimas Frari altoriuje. Kristaus pakilim√Ñ¬Ö akomponuoja dramati√Ö¬°kas peiza√Ö¬æas. Paveikslo kair√Ñ¬óje vaizduojamas kl√Ö¬´pantis r√Ñ¬óm√Ñ¬ójas Altobello Averoldo, de√Ö¬°in√Ñ¬óje √¢¬à¬í √Ö¬†v. Sebastijonas. Paveikslas rodo, kad Ticianas tuo metu jau buvo susipa√Ö¬æin√Ñ¬ôs su Rafaelio ir Mikeland√Ö¬æelo darbais, kuri√Ö¬≥ pavyzd√Ö¬æiai plito gravi√Ö¬´r√Ö¬≥ pavidalu po vis√Ñ¬Ö Italij√Ñ¬Ö. Tiesa, sunku nustatyti, ar Ticianas buvo mat√Ñ¬ôs originalius Rafaelio ir Mikeland√Ö¬æelo k√Ö¬´rinius tuo metu. Tolimesnes s√Ñ¬Ösajas su centrin√Ñ¬ós Italijos dailinink√Ö¬≥ k√Ö¬´ryba gali rodyti √¢¬Ä¬ûKristaus guldymas √Ñ¬Ø karst√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú (dabar Luvre), sukurtas apie 1525 m. ir buv√Ñ¬ôs Mantujos markiz√Ö¬≥ Gonzag√Ö¬≥ kolekcijoje. Paveikslo elementai pana√Ö¬°√Ö¬´s √Ñ¬Ø tos pa√Ñ?ios temos 1508 m. Rafaelio gars√Ö¬≥ darb√Ñ¬Ö, kur√Ñ¬Ø Ticianas gal√Ñ¬ójo √Ö¬æinoti i√Ö¬° gravi√Ö¬´r√Ö¬≥., 44144=Apie 1505√¢¬Ä¬ì1510 m. i√Ö¬° D√Ö¬æovanio Belinio studijos i√Ö¬°kilo trys pagrindiniai naujosios kartos Venecijos dailininkai: D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ó, Sebastianas Lu√Ñ?ianis ir Ticianas. Jaunieji meistrai buvo pripa√Ö¬æinti naujos √¢¬Ä¬ûarte moderna√¢¬Ä¬ú mokyklos vedliais, nes j√Ö¬≥ paveikslai lankstesni, i√Ö¬°vaduoti i√Ö¬° simetrijos ir papro√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥, kas nebuvo b√Ö¬´dinga D√Ö¬æovanio Belinio darbams. Anot D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æo Vazario, Ticianas i√Ö¬° prad√Ö¬æi√Ö¬≥ tap√Ñ¬ó D√Ö¬æovanio Belinio maniera, bet v√Ñ¬óliau buvo √Ñ¬Øtakotas D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ós, kuris buvo vyresniu dailininku. Anot Vazario, Ticianas taip gerai per√Ñ¬óm√Ñ¬ó D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ós tapybos stiliumi, kad greit abiej√Ö¬≥ dailinink√Ö¬≥ darb√Ö¬≥ buvo nebe√Ñ¬Ømanoma atskirti. Iki √Ö¬°iol keliolikos to laikotarpio paveiksl√Ö¬≥ autoryst√Ñ¬ó tarp D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ós ir Ticiano yra gin√Ñ?ytina. Vienas ankstyviausi√Ö¬≥ Ticiano darb√Ö¬≥ √¢¬Ä¬ûEcce Homo√¢¬Ä¬ú buvo ilgai priskirtas D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æonei., 8427=Po 1550 m. Ticianas buvo labai pasiturin√Ñ?iu Venecijos pilie√Ñ?iu. Jo pajamas sudar√Ñ¬ó ne ven pajamos i√Ö¬° paveiksl√Ö¬≥, bet ir i√Ö¬° √Ö¬æem√Ñ¬ós √Ö¬´kio veiklos, komercijos. 1556 m. imperatorius Karolis V pasitrauk√Ñ¬ó i√Ö¬° sosto √Ñ¬Ø vienuoyn√Ñ¬Ö ir kartu pasi√Ñ¬óm√Ñ¬ó Ticiano paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö √¢¬Ä¬ûTrejyb√Ñ¬ó√¢¬Ä¬ú (arba √¢¬Ä¬ûPaskutinis teismas√¢¬Ä¬ú), baigt√Ñ¬Ö 1554 m. (dabar Prado muziejuje). Kitu svarbiausiu Ticiano u√Ö¬æsakovu tapo Karolio V √Ñ¬Øp√Ñ¬ódinis karalius Pilypas II, kuriam per sekan√Ñ?ius 25 metus dailininkas siunt√Ñ¬ó pa√Ñ?ius geriausius savo paveikslus. Ticianas jau 1548 m. buvo nutap√Ñ¬ôs pirm√Ñ¬Öj√Ñ¬Ø Pilypo II portret√Ñ¬Ö (nei√Ö¬°√Ö¬°lik√Ñ¬ôs), apie 1550 m., antros vie√Ö¬°nag√Ñ¬ós Augsburge metu √¢¬à¬í antr√Ñ¬Öj√Ñ¬Ø, kuriame Pilypas vaizduojamas su √Ö¬°arvais. Pastarasis jaunajam sosto √Ñ¬Øp√Ñ¬ódiniui, kuriam tuo metu buvo apie 24 metus, nepatiko. 1556 m. Ticianas prad√Ñ¬ójo trij√Ö¬≥ paveiksl√Ö¬≥ serij√Ñ¬Ö pagal Ovidijaus √¢¬Ä¬ûMetamorfozes√¢¬Ä¬ú. Du i√Ö¬° j√Ö¬≥: √¢¬Ä¬ûDiana ir Akteonas√¢¬Ä¬ú ir √¢¬Ä¬ûDiana ir Kaliston√Ñ¬ó√¢¬Ä¬ú, 1559 m. buvo pasi√Ö¬≥sti karaliui. Tre√Ñ?iasis, √¢¬Ä¬ûAkteono mirtis√¢¬Ä¬ú, taip ir nebuvo pabaigtas, rastas po Ticiano mirties jo dirbtuv√Ñ¬óse. V√Ñ¬ólyvieji Ticiano mitologiniai paveikslai tapo psichologi√Ö¬°kai sud√Ñ¬ótingesniais, dramati√Ö¬°kesniais u√Ö¬æ ankstyvuosius, kuriuose daugiausiai buvo vaizduojamas ner√Ö¬´pestingas antikini√Ö¬≥ heroj√Ö¬≥ ir diev√Ö¬≥ gyvenimas. Apie 1559√¢¬à¬í1562 m. Ticianas nutap√Ñ¬ó √¢¬Ä¬ûEuropos pagrobim√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú, dar vien√Ñ¬Ö paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö Pilypui II. Gali b√Ö¬´ti, kad tarp karaliaus ir dailininko buvo susitarimas d√Ñ¬ól tapybos darb√Ö¬≥., 42906=1507√¢¬Ä¬ì1508 m. D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ó buvo valstyb√Ñ¬ós i√Ö¬°rinktas sukurti freskas ant atstatytos Fondaco dei Tedeschi, vokie√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥ pirkli√Ö¬≥ √Ñ¬Østaigos, sien√Ö¬≥. Ticianas ir Morto da Feltre dirbo kartu su juo. Freskos pra√Ö¬æuvo gaisro metu, keli fragmentai i√Ö¬°liko. Kai kurie j√Ö¬≥ darbai √Ö¬æinomi i√Ö¬° Fontanos gravi√Ö¬´r√Ö¬≥. Ticianas tapo D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ós asistentu, bet am√Ö¬æininkai laik√Ñ¬ó jo darbus √Ñ¬Øsp√Ö¬´dingesniais. Fondaco dei Tedeschi fasado fresk√Ö¬≥ (dabar beveik sunaikint√Ö¬≥) pavyzd√Ö¬æiai, rodo, kad j√Ö¬≥ santykiuose jaut√Ñ¬ósi konkurencija., 36438=1514 m. Ticiano sukurtas alegorinis, lyrinis paveikslas √¢¬Ä¬ûDangi√Ö¬°koji ir √Ö¬æemi√Ö¬°koji meil√Ñ¬ó√¢¬Ä¬ú dar turi D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æonei b√Ö¬´dingo poeti√Ö¬°kumo, bet greitu laiku Ticianas pasuko prie gyv√Ö¬≥ ir dinami√Ö¬°k√Ö¬≥ scen√Ö¬≥ vaizdavimo.[6] √Ö¬†io stilistinio pasikeitimo i√Ö¬°rai√Ö¬°ka tapo altoriaus paveikslas √¢¬Ä¬ûMergel√Ñ¬ós Marijos pa√Ñ¬ómimas √Ñ¬Ø dang√Ö¬≥√¢¬Ä¬ú Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?ioje. Paveikslas u√Ö¬æsakytas 1516 m., kai mir√Ñ¬ó D√Ö¬æovanis Belinis, ir √Ö¬°is u√Ö¬æsakymas rodo Ticiano pripa√Ö¬æinim√Ñ¬Ö pagrindiniu miesto dailininku. Paveikslas pa√Ö¬°ventintas 1518 m. gegu√Ö¬æ√Ñ¬ós 20 d. ir pralenk√Ñ¬ó visus iki tol sukurtus Ticiano paveikslus didybe, dinamika, kompozicijos sud√Ñ¬ótingumu ir spalv√Ö¬≥ puo√Ö¬°numu. Paveikslas iki √Ö¬°iol laikomas did√Ö¬æiausiu, kada nors atliktu ant med√Ö¬æio. Jo matmenys 960 x 360 cm.[7] Paveikslas suk√Ñ¬ól√Ñ¬ó sensacij√Ñ¬Ö ir tapo lemiamu i√Ö¬°garsinant Ticiano vard√Ñ¬Ö Italijoje ir po to √¢¬à¬í u√Ö¬æsienyje, bei vienu svarbiausi√Ö¬≥ Venecijos dail√Ñ¬ós istorijoje. √¢¬Ä¬ûMergel√Ñ¬ós Marijos pa√Ñ¬ómime √Ñ¬Ø dang√Ö¬≥√¢¬Ä¬ú vaizduojama Mergel√Ñ¬ó Marija tarp angel√Ö¬≥, kylanti √Ñ¬Ø dang√Ö¬≥, kur j√Ñ¬Ö pasitinka Dievas T√Ñ¬óvas, apa√Ñ?ioje Marij√Ñ¬Ö lydin√Ñ?iais vaizduojami apa√Ö¬°talai. Pusapval√Ñ¬ó debes√Ö¬≥ juosta atskiria √Ö¬æemi√Ö¬°k√Ñ¬Öj√Ñ¬Ö erdv√Ñ¬ô nuo dangi√Ö¬°kos. Dangaus auksin√Ñ¬ó √Ö¬°viesa ap√Ö¬°vie√Ñ?ia angel√Ö¬≥ veidus., 3191=Ticianas buvo apie 90 met√Ö¬≥, kai 1576 m. rugpj√Ö¬´√Ñ?io 27 d. mir√Ñ¬ó nuo maro, siaubusio Venecij√Ñ¬Ö. Jis buvo vienintel√Ñ¬ó Venecijos maro auka, kuriai pagerbti surengtos laidotuv√Ñ¬ós ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?ioje. Jis buvo palaidotas Frari ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?ioje (Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari), kaip buvo ketinta. Ticianas guli netoli √Ö¬æymaus savo paveikslo √¢¬Ä¬ûPezaro Madonos√¢¬Ä¬ú (√¢¬Ä¬ûMadonna di Ca' Pesaro√¢¬Ä¬ú). Joks paminklas ne√Ö¬æym√Ñ¬ójo jo kapo, kol √Ö¬æymiai v√Ñ¬óliau Venecij√Ñ¬Ö valdantys Austrijos pareig√Ö¬´nai √Ñ¬Øgaliojo Antonij√Ö¬≥ Kanov√Ñ¬Ö pastatyti paminkl√Ñ¬Ö, ta√Ñ?iau √Ö¬°iame buvo palaidota Kanovos √Ö¬°irdis, o dailininkui XIX a. sukurtas dar kitas monumentas. I√Ö¬° karto po Ticiano mirties tos pa√Ñ?ios epidemijos metu mir√Ñ¬ó jo s√Ö¬´nus ir tapybos asistentas Oracijus. Jo prabangi√Ñ¬Ö vil√Ñ¬Ö maro metu nusiaub√Ñ¬ó vagys., 41370=Iki 1510 m. n√Ñ¬óra dokumentuotas nei vienas Ticiano darbas. √Ö¬†iais metais Ticianas gavo u√Ö¬æakym√Ñ¬Ö freskoms Padujos Scuola del Santo √Ñ¬Østaigoje. Neabejotinai Ticianas jau tuomet tur√Ñ¬ójo b√Ö¬´ti gerai √Ö¬æinomu dailininku ir suk√Ö¬´r√Ñ¬ôs reik√Ö¬°ming√Ö¬≥ darb√Ö¬≥, nes kitaip neb√Ö¬´t√Ö¬≥ gav√Ñ¬ôs presti√Ö¬æinio u√Ö¬æsakymo. Heraklio freska Morosini r√Ö¬´muose, kai kuri√Ö¬≥ ekspert√Ö¬≥ nuomone, yra ankstyviausias Ticiano darbas. Tarp priskiriam√Ö¬≥ ankstyv√Ö¬≥j√Ö¬≥ darb√Ö¬≥ minimas paveikslas √¢¬Ä¬ûJakopas Pezaras, pristatomas √Ö¬†v. Petrui popie√Ö¬æiaus Aleksandro VI√¢¬Ä¬ú, kuris rodo D√Ö¬æovanio Belinio √Ñ¬Øtak√Ñ¬Ö. Ticianas tuo metu nutap√Ñ¬ó kelet√Ñ¬Ö ma√Ö¬æ√Ö¬≥ madonos su k√Ö¬´dikiu √Ö¬æanro paveiksl√Ö¬≥, tarp kuri√Ö¬≥ i√Ö¬°siskiria √¢¬Ä¬ûMadona √Ñ?igon√Ñ¬ó√¢¬Ä¬ú (Vienos meno istorijos muziejus, pavadintas taip, nes vaizduojama madona yra juodbruva). Kitas ankstyvasis paveikslas √¢¬Ä¬ì √¢¬Ä¬ûMarijos ir El√Ö¬æbietos apsilankymas√¢¬Ä¬ú (Akademijos galerijoje Venecijoje). Jau √Ö¬°iuo ankstyvuoju laikotarpiu Ticianas parod√Ñ¬ó savo sugeb√Ñ¬ójimus aliejine technika vaizduoti subtil√Ö¬≥ √Ö¬°viesos ir √Ö¬°e√Ö¬°√Ñ¬óli√Ö¬≥ √Ö¬æaism√Ñ¬Ö, spalvos ir tono niuansus, kuriais jam neprilygo nei D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ó, nei Sebastianas del Pjombas., 3773=Apie 1570 m. Ticianas nutap√Ñ¬ó v√Ñ¬ólyv√Ñ¬Öj√Ñ¬Ø √¢¬Ä¬ûDygli√Ö¬≥ vainiko u√Ö¬æd√Ñ¬ójim√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú, √¢¬Ä¬ûTarkvinij√Ö¬≥ ir Lukrecij√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú ir √¢¬Ä¬ûMarsijo odos nudyrim√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú. Tarp garsiausi√Ö¬≥ jo v√Ñ¬ólyv√Ö¬≥j√Ö¬≥ darb√Ö¬≥: √¢¬Ä¬û√Ö¬†v. Lauryno mirtis√¢¬Ä¬ú (apie 1567, dabar Madride), kurtas pagal dar ankstesn√Ñ¬Ø, 1548 m. atlikt√Ñ¬Ö altoriaus paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö Venecijos Gesuiti ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?ioje. Paskutinio paveikslo, kuris buvo skirtas Frari ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?iai, Ticianas nebaig√Ñ¬ó. Jo √¢¬Ä¬ûPiet√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú u√Ö¬æbaig√Ñ¬ó mokinys Palma Jaunesnysis., 17510=Apie 1540 m. Ticianas buvo vienu garsiausi√Ö¬≥ Europos dailinink√Ö¬≥, gaudavo u√Ö¬æsakym√Ö¬≥ i√Ö¬° u√Ö¬æsienio, tikriausiai jau tuo metu tur√Ñ¬ójo dideles dirbtuves Venecijoje. Apie 1540 m. nutapytas √¢¬Ä¬ûDygli√Ö¬≥ vainiko u√Ö¬æd√Ñ¬ójimas√¢¬Ä¬ú. √Ö¬†is paveikslas rodo manieristin√Ñ¬ós stilistikos √Ñ¬Øtak√Ñ¬Ö, kuri√Ñ¬Ö Ticianas gal√Ñ¬ójo perimti i√Ö¬° D√Ö¬æulijaus Romano fresk√Ö¬≥ Mantujoje. D√Ö¬æulijus Romanas buvo oficialiu Gonzag√Ö¬≥ dvaro dailininku, Rafaelio mokinys ir vienas reik√Ö¬°mingiausi√Ö¬≥ Romos mokyklos manierizmo atstov√Ö¬≥. Auk√Ö¬°t√Ñ¬Ö jo k√Ö¬´rybos vertinim√Ñ¬Ö rodo Ticiano nemokamai jam sukurtas portretas. Romano freskos T√Ñ¬ó r√Ö¬´muose, vaizduojan√Ñ?ios titan√Ö¬≥ ir diev√Ö¬≥ kovas, tur√Ñ¬ójo reik√Ö¬°mingos √Ñ¬Øtakos Ticiano k√Ö¬´rybai. √¢¬Ä¬ûDygli√Ö¬≥ vainiko u√Ö¬æd√Ñ¬ójimas√¢¬Ä¬ú buvo skirtas Milano Santa Maria delle Grazie ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?iai ir akomponavo visuotinai √Ö¬°edevru pripa√Ö¬æint√Ñ¬Ö Leonardo da Vin√Ñ?io √¢¬Ä¬ûPaskutin√Ñ¬ô vakarien√Ñ¬ô√¢¬Ä¬ú. Napoleono kar√Ö¬≥ metu paveikslas buvo pagrobtas ir nebegr√Ñ¬Ö√Ö¬æintas √Ñ¬Ø Italij√Ñ¬Ö (dabar Luvre)., 29528=1519 m. √Ñ¬Øtakinga Pezaro gimin√Ñ¬ó u√Ö¬æsak√Ñ¬ó altoriaus paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö v√Ñ¬ól Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?ioje Venecijoje. √Ö¬†is paveikslas buvo skirtas Venecijos laivyno pergalei Santa Maura m√Ö¬´√Ö¬°yje prie√Ö¬° turkus osmanus pamin√Ñ¬óti. Laivynui vadovavo vyskupas-admirolas Jakopas Pezaras, kur√Ñ¬Ø Ticianas jau buvo pavaizdav√Ñ¬ôs viename ankstyv√Ö¬≥j√Ö¬≥ savo paveiksl√Ö¬≥. Nors Venecijos pergal√Ñ¬ó m√Ö¬´√Ö¬°yje buvo menka, ta√Ñ?au tai nesutrukd√Ñ¬ó Pezaro giminei u√Ö¬æsakyti diding√Ñ¬Ö altoriaus paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö, kuris labiau liudijo ne tiek apie karin√Ñ¬ô s√Ñ¬ókm√Ñ¬ô, kiek apie pa√Ñ?ios Pezaro gimin√Ñ¬ós didyb√Ñ¬ô. Paveikslas, paprastai √Ö¬æinomas √¢¬Ä¬ûPezaro Madonos√¢¬Ä¬ú pavadinimu, buvo dar novatori√Ö¬°kesnis u√Ö¬æ gretimai nutapyt√Ñ¬Ö √¢¬Ä¬ûMarijos pa√Ñ¬ómim√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú ir laikomas dar vienu i√Ö¬° pa√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥ garsiausi√Ö¬≥ Ticiano ir Venecijos dail√Ñ¬ós darb√Ö¬≥. Jame Ticianas gal√Ñ¬ójo kiek atsiplaiduoti nuo ikonografini√Ö¬≥ taisykli√Ö¬≥, kadangi paveikslas buvo skirtas ne did√Ö¬æiajam ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?ios altoriuj. Jame Ticianas sulau√Ö¬æ√Ñ¬ó tradicin√Ñ¬Ø altoriaus paveiksl√Ö¬≥ veik√Ñ¬ój√Ö¬≥ vaizdavim√Ñ¬Ö, i√Ö¬°d√Ñ¬óstydamas veik√Ñ¬ójus ne viename plane ties √Ö¬æi√Ö¬´rovo akimis, o diagonaliai. √Ö¬†iai tapybai tikriausiai tur√Ñ¬ójo poveik√Ñ¬Ø novatori√Ö¬°kas Sebastiano del Pjombo altoriaus √Ö¬†v. Jono Chrizostomo paveikslas, atliktas apie 1510 m. √¢¬Ä¬ûPezaro Madonos√¢¬Ä¬ú erdv√Ñ¬ó atrodo iracionalia ir labai skirtinga nuo Rafaelio mokyklos kruop√Ö¬°√Ñ?iai suplanuot√Ö¬≥, simetri√Ö¬°k√Ö¬≥ erdvi√Ö¬≥. Sunku nustatyti, kokiame pastate yra paveiksle vaizduojamas Madonos sostas ir kur nueina, ar k√Ñ¬Ö remia vaizduojamos kolonos. Paveikslas u√Ö¬æbaigtas 1526 m. ir √Ñ¬Øtakojo v√Ñ¬ólesnius baroko k√Ö¬´rinius, kuriuose intuityviam paveikslo objekto vaizdavimui atiduodama pirmenyb√Ñ¬ó prie√Ö¬° racionalaus planavimo ir paruo√Ö¬°imo metodus., 21156=Apie 1530 m. Ticianas nutap√Ñ¬ó Mantujos markizo Federiko II Gonzagos su √Ö¬°unimi portret√Ñ¬Ö. Tais pa√Ñ?iais metais, tikriausiai Fran√Ñ?esko Marijos I dela Rover√Ñ¬ós u√Ö¬æsakymu, buvo nutapyta √¢¬Ä¬ûMarija Magdalena√¢¬Ä¬ú. √Ö¬†is, s√Ñ¬Ölyginai religinis paveikslas buvo labai ne√Ñ¬Øprastas. Jame Marija Magdalena vaizduojama nuoga, prisidengusi tik savo plaukais. Marija Magdalena tur√Ñ¬ót√Ö¬≥ b√Ö¬´ti vaizduojama atsiskyrusi dykumoje, li√Ö¬´dinti J√Ñ¬ózaus Kristaus, ta√Ñ?iau paveiksle neabejotinai did√Ö¬æiausi√Ñ¬Ö d√Ñ¬ómes√Ñ¬Ø atkreipia Marijos nuogas k√Ö¬´nas, o ne jos dvasin√Ñ¬ó b√Ö¬´sena.[11] 1530 m. Ticianas nutap√Ñ¬ó altoriaus paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö √¢¬Ä¬û√Ö¬†v. Petro Kankinio mirtis√¢¬Ä¬ú √Ö¬†v. Jono ir Pauliaus bazilikoje Venecijoje. Tai buvo dar vienas did√Ö¬æiuli√Ö¬≥ matmen√Ö¬≥ altorinis paveikslas ir ilgai laikytas vienu geriausi√Ö¬≥ Ticiano k√Ö¬´rini√Ö¬≥. Paveikslas pra√Ö¬æuvo 1867 m. gaisro metu.[12] Apie 1534-36 m. Ticianas nutap√Ñ¬ó Mantujos markiz√Ñ¬ós Izabel√Ñ¬ós d√¢¬Ä¬ôEst√Ñ¬ó portret√Ñ¬Ö, kuriame √¢¬Ä¬ûpajaunino√¢¬Ä¬ú tuo metu apie 60 m. am√Ö¬æiaus markiz√Ñ¬ô apie 40-√Ñ?ia met√Ö¬≥. Apie 1535 m. Ticianas baig√Ñ¬ó kit√Ñ¬Ö nei√Ö¬°likus√Ñ¬Ø altoriaus paveiksl√Ñ¬Ö √¢¬Ä¬ûGeroji naujiena√¢¬Ä¬ú, skirt√Ñ¬Ö Santa Maria degli Angeli ba√Ö¬æny√Ñ?iai Murane. Paveikslas buvo atmestas d√Ñ¬ól pernelyg auk√Ö¬°tos kainos ir v√Ñ¬óliau j√Ñ¬Ø √Ñ¬Øsigijo imperatorius Karolis V. Paveikslas tikriausiai buvo sunaikintas Ispanijoje Napoleono kar√Ö¬≥ metu. 1538 m. minimas atliktas vienas √Ö¬æinomiausi√Ö¬≥ Ticiano paveiksl√Ö¬≥ √¢¬Ä¬ûUrbino Venera√¢¬Ä¬ú, kuris buvo modeliuotas pagal D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ós √¢¬Ä¬ûMiegan√Ñ?i√Ñ¬Ö Vener√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú. J√Ñ¬Ø u√Ö¬æsak√Ñ¬ó Urbino hercogas Gvidobaldas II dela Rover√Ñ¬ó. Vienu garsiausi√Ö¬≥ Ticiano portret√Ö¬≥ minimas Klarisos Stroci portretas, sukurtas 1542 m. Klarisa buvo 2 met√Ö¬≥ am√Ö¬æiaus dviej√Ö¬≥ galing√Ö¬≥ Italijos gimini√Ö¬≥, Stroci√Ö¬≥ ir Medi√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥, atstov√Ö¬≥ √Ö¬°eimos vaikas. Jos status√Ñ¬Ö demonstruoja aplinka: prabangi√Ö¬≥ to meto r√Ö¬´m√Ö¬≥ kambarys ir antikinio altoriaus fragmentas su putti reljefu., 42150=Po ankstyvos D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æon√Ñ¬ós mirties 1510 m. Ticianas kur√Ñ¬Ø laik√Ñ¬Ö tap√Ñ¬ó D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æonei b√Ö¬´dinga maniera ir u√Ö¬æbaig√Ñ¬ó kelet√Ñ¬Ö jo paveiksl√Ö¬≥, tarp j√Ö¬≥ √¢¬Ä¬ûMiegan√Ñ?i√Ñ¬Ö Vener√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú, bet greitai jis i√Ö¬°vyst√Ñ¬ó savo stili√Ö¬≥, kuriam b√Ö¬´dinga drali ir ekspresyvi tapymo technika, scen√Ö¬≥ dinamika. 1511 m. i√Ö¬° Venecijos √Ñ¬Ø Rom√Ñ¬Ö i√Ö¬°vyko Sebastianas Lu√Ñ?ianis, kuris v√Ñ¬óliau buvo pramintas Sebastianu del Pjombu. Per trump√Ñ¬Ö laikotarp√Ñ¬Ø Venecijoje Sebastianas del Pjombas paliko kapitalini√Ö¬≥ darb√Ö¬≥, kurie √Ñ¬Øtakojo Tician√Ñ¬Ö., 16037=1543 m. Ticianas prad√Ñ¬ójo dirbti √Ñ¬Øtakingiausiam to meto Europos u√Ö¬æsakovui, kuriam dar nebuvo dirb√Ñ¬ôs √¢¬à¬í Romos popie√Ö¬æiui. Paulius III vie√Ö¬°√Ñ¬ójo Bolonijoje ir Feraroje, kur Ticianas j√Ñ¬Ø aplank√Ñ¬ó ir nutap√Ñ¬ó portret√Ñ¬Ö. Popie√Ö¬æius jame pavaizduotas pagal Rafaelio Julijaus II portreto suformuot√Ñ¬Ö popie√Ö¬æi√Ö¬≥ portreto tradicij√Ñ¬Ö √¢¬à¬í s√Ñ¬ódintis k√Ñ¬ód√Ñ¬óje, atsipalaidav√Ñ¬ôs, tarsi nematantis √Ö¬æi√Ö¬´rovo. 1545 m. Ticianas nutap√Ñ¬ó Venecijos do√Ö¬æo Andrea Gritti portret√Ñ¬Ö ir atvyko √Ñ¬Ø Rom√Ñ¬Ö, kur viliojo turtingi u√Ö¬æsakovai, ypa√Ñ? galinga popie√Ö¬æiaus Farnezi√Ö¬≥ gimin√Ñ¬ó. Ticiano gidu po √¢¬Ä¬ûam√Ö¬æin√Ñ¬Öj√Ñ¬Ø miest√Ñ¬Ö√¢¬Ä¬ú buvo popie√Ö¬æiaus paskirtas D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æas Vazaris. Ticiano k√Ö¬´ryboje susipa√Ö¬æinimas su Rafaelio, Mikeland√Ö¬æelo, Bramant√Ñ¬ós ir kit√Ö¬≥ meninink√Ö¬≥ k√Ö¬´riniais nepaliko didelio p√Ñ¬ódsako. Jam tuo metu buvo vir√Ö¬° 50 met√Ö¬≥ ir jis buvo susiformavusiu menininku. Visgi Mikeland√Ö¬æelo √¢¬Ä¬ûPaskutinio teismo√¢¬Ä¬ú freskos motyv√Ö¬≥ galima √Ñ¬Ø√Ö¬ævelgti keleto sekan√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥ met√Ö¬≥ Ticiano k√Ö¬´ryboje. Pagrindiniu Ticiano darbu Romoje tapo portretas √¢¬Ä¬ûPopie√Ö¬æius Paulius III su an√Ö¬´kais Otavijumi ir Alesandru Farnez√Ñ¬ómis√¢¬Ä¬ú. Portretas nebuvo baigtas, galima sp√Ñ¬óti, d√Ñ¬ól to, kad jame pavaizduoti sud√Ñ¬ótingi popie√Ö¬æiaus ir jo an√Ö¬´k√Ö¬≥ santykiai. √Ö¬†is portretas tikriausiai turi s√Ñ¬Ösaj√Ö¬≥ su Rafaelio garsiuoju popie√Ö¬æiaus Leono X su dviem kardinolais portretu., 55035=Ticianas Ve√Ñ?elis, paprastai vadinamas tik vardu Ticianas (it. Tiziano Vecelli arba Tiziano Vecellio, apie 1480√¢¬Ä¬ì1490 m. Pjev√Ñ¬ó di Kador√Ñ¬ó prie Beluno, Venecijos respublikoje √¢¬Ä¬ì 1576 m. rugpj√Ö¬´√Ñ?io 27 d.

D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æas Vazaris skepti√Ö¬°kai vertino √Ö¬°iuos paveikslus, tikino, kad jie pakenk√Ñ¬ó Ticiano reputacijai ir geriau dailininkas j√Ö¬≥ i√Ö¬°vis neb√Ö¬´t√Ö¬≥ tap√Ñ¬ôs. Kartu Vazaris labai tiksliai nusak√Ñ¬ó Ticiano v√Ñ¬ólyvosios tapybos pasikeitimo esm√Ñ¬ô: pla√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥ ir gili√Ö¬≥ pot√Ñ¬ópi√Ö¬≥ naudojim√Ñ¬Ö, kurie i√Ö¬° toliau √Ö¬æi√Ö¬´rov√Ö¬≥ akyse susiliedavo √Ñ¬Ø puik√Ö¬≥ vaizd√Ñ¬Ö, nors i√Ö¬° arti paveikslas atrodydavo atliktas labai ner√Ö¬´pestingai.

Ticianas buvo √Ö¬æymiausiu to meto Venecijos dailininku, bet d√Ñ¬ól to, kad dauguma jo paveiksl√Ö¬≥ buvo u√Ö¬æsakomi i√Ö¬° u√Ö¬æsienio, po 1560-√Ö¬≥j√Ö¬≥ susidar√Ñ¬ó s√Ñ¬Ölygos mieste i√Ö¬°kilti kitiems dailininkams, kurie buvo labai √Ñ¬Øtakoti Ticiano √¢¬à¬í Tintoretui ir Paolui Veronezei. Po 1560-√Ö¬≥j√Ö¬≥ Ticianas prad√Ñ¬ójo labiau r√Ö¬´pintis savo paveiksl√Ö¬≥ populiarinimu gravi√Ö¬´romis.

Privilegija galiojo 15 met√Ö¬≥. Tai buvo labai retas atvejis tuo metu. Ticianas taip paai√Ö¬°kino savo sprendim√Ñ¬Ö:, 38133=1512 m. Ticianas i√Ö¬° Padujos gr√Ñ¬Ø√Ö¬æo √Ñ¬Ø Venecij√Ñ¬Ö. Tuo metu daugiausiai dirbo vidutin√Ñ¬ós klas√Ñ¬ós u√Ö¬æsakovams. 1512 m. √¢¬Ä¬ûVyro portretas√¢¬Ä¬ú tikriausiai vaizduoja vien√Ñ¬Ö i√Ö¬° √Ö¬°i√Ö¬≥ u√Ö¬æsakov√Ö¬≥.

Ticianas √Ñ¬Øgijo tarpininko patent√Ñ¬Ö Fondaco dei Tedeschi (valstyb√Ñ¬ós sand√Ñ¬ólyje vokie√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥ pirkliams), vadinam√Ñ¬Ö La Sanseria ar Senseria (tai privilegija, kurios tro√Ö¬°ko visi kylantys ar i√Ö¬°kil√Ñ¬ô menininkai) ir tapo vyriausyb√Ñ¬ós darb√Ö¬≥ pri√Ö¬æi√Ö¬´r√Ñ¬ótoju, buvo atsakingu u√Ö¬æ D√Ö¬æovanio Belinio nebaigt√Ö¬≥ paveiksl√Ö¬≥ u√Ö¬æbaigim√Ñ¬Ö Did√Ö¬æiosios Tarybos sal√Ñ¬óje Do√Ö¬æ√Ö¬≥ r√Ö¬´muose.

Tuo pat metu jis sudar√Ñ¬ó priveligijuot√Ñ¬Ö susitarim√Ñ¬Ö d√Ñ¬ól paveiksl√Ö¬≥. Patentas garantavo jam 20 kar√Ö¬´n√Ö¬≥ i√Ö¬°mok√Ñ¬Ö kas metus ir atleido nuo tam tikr√Ö¬≥ mokes√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥, bet u√Ö¬æ tai jis tur√Ñ¬ójo nutapyti b√Ö¬´sim√Ö¬≥ do√Ö¬æ√Ö¬≥ portretus apmokant 8 kar√Ö¬´nomis u√Ö¬æ kiekvien√Ñ¬Ö.

I√Ö¬° t√Ö¬≥ laik√Ö¬≥ kil√Ñ¬ôs anekdotas, kur√Ñ¬Ø papasakojo Ticiano XVII a. biografas Karlas Ridolfis. Es√Ñ¬Ö, kai Ticianas tap√Ñ¬ó Karolio V portret√Ñ¬Ö, jam i√Ö¬° rank√Ö¬≥ i√Ö¬°krito teptukas.

Ne√Ö¬æymus dailininkas ir meno dirbini√Ö¬≥ prekiautojas Sebastianas Cukatas, kurio s√Ö¬´n√Ö¬´s tapo √Ö¬æymiais mozaikininkais ir kuris tikriausiai buvo √Ö¬°eimos draugas, suorganizavo, kad broliai patekt√Ö¬≥ √Ñ¬Ø pagyvenusio D√Ö¬æentil√Ñ¬ós Belinio studij√Ñ¬Ö, i√Ö¬° kurios jie per√Ñ¬ójo pas jo brol√Ñ¬Ø D√Ö¬æovan√Ñ¬Ø Belin√Ñ¬Ø[5]. Anot D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æo Vazario, i√Ö¬° 1568 m. i√Ö¬°leist√Ö¬≥ biografij√Ö¬≥, Ticianas i√Ö¬° pat prad√Ö¬æi√Ö¬≥ mok√Ñ¬ósi pas D√Ö¬æovan√Ñ¬Ø Belin√Ñ¬Ø. Tuo metu Beliniai, ypa√Ñ? D√Ö¬æovanis, buvo svarbiausi dailininkai mieste. Ticianas j√Ö¬≥ dirbtuv√Ñ¬óse rado grup√Ñ¬ô ma√Ö¬ædaug savo am√Ö¬æiaus jaunuoli√Ö¬≥, tarp kuri√Ö¬≥ buvo D√Ö¬æovanis Palma da Serinalta, Lorencas Lotas, Sebastianas Lu√Ñ?ianis, v√Ñ¬óliau pramintas Pjombu ir D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æas da Kastelfrankas, pramintas D√Ö¬æord√Ö¬æone. Fran√Ñ?eskas Ve√Ñ?elis, Ticiano jaunesnysis brolis, tapo gan √Ö¬æymiu Venecijos dailininku., 50018=Ticiano tiksli gimimo data ne√Ö¬æinoma. Kai jis buvo senas, viename lai√Ö¬°ke Pilypui II tvirtino, kad yra gim√Ñ¬ôs 1477 m., bet tai ma√Ö¬æai tik√Ñ¬ótina.[4] Paprastai priimama, kad jis gim√Ñ¬ó 1480√¢¬Ä¬ì1490 m. laikotarpiu Pjev√Ñ¬ó di Kador√Ñ¬ós kaime, tuometin√Ñ¬óje Venecijos respublikoje, Dolomitini√Ö¬≥ kaln√Ö¬≥ pap√Ñ¬ód√Ñ¬óje. Linkstama laikyti, kad tikslesn√Ñ¬ó jo gimimo data yra 1488√¢¬à¬í1490 metai. Ticianas buvo Gregorijaus Ve√Ñ?elio (it. Gregorio di Conte dei Vecelli), pasi√Ö¬æym√Ñ¬ójusio tarybos nario ir kario, ir jo √Ö¬æmonos Liu√Ñ?ijos s√Ö¬´nus. Jo t√Ñ¬óvas buvo Pjev√Ñ¬ó di Kador√Ñ¬ós pilies valdytojas ir vietoj savinink√Ö¬≥ pri√Ö¬æi√Ö¬´r√Ñ¬ójo vietines kasyklas[5]. Daugyb√Ñ¬ó giminai√Ñ?i√Ö¬≥, √Ñ¬Øskaitant senel√Ñ¬Ø, buvo notarai ir √Ö¬°eima buvo gerai √Ñ¬Øsitvirtinusi apylink√Ñ¬óse, kurias vald√Ñ¬ó Venecija. Dailininko ry√Ö¬°iai su gimtosiomis vietomis buvo labai stipr√Ö¬´s: jis i√Ö¬°laik√Ñ¬ó nuosav√Ñ¬Ö nam√Ñ¬Ö ir nuolat lankydavosi kaime per vis√Ñ¬Ö savo gyvenim√Ñ¬Ö.}"

Ook vroeg hij alle Vlaamse formaties nooit nog een federale regering te vormen zonder Vlaamse meerderheid.[5], 30010=Het kartel was in 2007 de overwinnaar van de federale verkiezingen in Vlaanderen. De partij behaalde vijf rechtstreeks verkozenen in de Kamer en twee in de Senaat. Door opvolging telde de N-VA 6 leden in de Kamer. Voorzitter Bart De Wever boekte een goed persoonlijk resultaat. Met ruim 41.000 voorkeurstemmen werd hij de op twee na populairste politicus in de kieskring Antwerpen., 19722=De regering Verhofstadt II voerde vervolgens ook voor de Vlaamse parlementsverkiezingen in juni 2004 een kiesdrempel van 5% in., 43645=N-VA werd bij de verkiezingen de grote overwinnaar in Vlaanderen. In 41 gemeenten werd het de grootste lokale partij, waaronder in Antwerpen, waar voorzitter Bart De Wever burgemeester werd. Op andere plaatsen werd de partij vaak ook een van de grootste partijen met percentages rond de 20 procent. Op provinciaal niveau werd N-VA de grootste partij met circa 28% van de stemmen. In Vlaams-Brabant, Antwerpen en Oost-Vlaanderen werd het de grootste partij; in Limburg en West-Vlaanderen tweede.[10][11] In zijn overwinningsspeech had De Wever het over een signaal voor de regering-Di Rupo. Hij bestempelde de overwinning van zijn partij en het verlies van alle regeringspartijen als teken dat de Vlamingen de ""belastingsregering"" niet lusten. Hij waarschuwde de Franstaligen om zich voor te bereiden op confederalisme, waar de partij voor zal ijveren bij de volgende verkiezingen, in 2014. Di Rupo wimpelde de waarschuwing af door te wijzen op het lokale karakter van de verkiezingen.[12], 28582=Medio maart 2007 raakte bekend dat de directeur van de Bank Card Company (uitgever van Visa en Mastercard), Jan Jambon zich kandidaat stelde voor de federale parlementsverkiezingen op de Antwerpse CD&V/N-VA-lijst. Jambon is sinds oktober 2006 schepen van financi√É¬´n en lokale economie in Brasschaat. Samen met Peter De Roover bouwde hij in de jaren 90 de Vlaamse Volksbeweging opnieuw uit tot een slagkrachtige organisatie binnen de Vlaamse Beweging. Jambon leek aanvankelijk een rijzende ster binnen de N-VA, maar viel in de loop van 2014 van zijn voetstuk door een reeks ongelukkige uitspraken. Zo verklaarde hij dat werklozen eerst hun huis en andere bezittingen moeten verkopen vooraleer zij een werkloosheidsuitkering kunnen krijgen. Ook stelde hij dat het inschrijvingsgeld voor de universiteiten fors verhoogd zou moeten worden., 32903=Op 23 september bevestigde voorzitster Marianne Thyssen van CD&V na een algemene vergadering van haar partij in Zellik dat er wat CD&V betrof een kartelbreuk was op nationaal en Vlaams niveau, niet op lokaal en provinciaal niveau.[3], 25167=In de dagen na de breuk binnen het Vlaams kartel vonden discrete onderhandelingen plaats tussen de top van CD&V en de N-VA. Er werd versneld een voorstel van programma opgemaakt met het oog op de federale verkiezingen van 2007. Het bereikte akkoord tussen CD&V en de N-VA, dat normaal besproken zou worden op de partijraad van januari 2007, werd door de omstandigheden reeds aan de partijraad van 9 december 2006 voorgelegd. CD&V had N-VA voor de keuze gesteld: een kartel zonder Dedecker op de gemeenschappelijke lijst, of geen kartel. Op die N-VA-partijraad van 9 december werd, op basis van het akkoord, beslist om voor de federale verkiezingen van 2007 een kartel te vormen met de CD&V. De beslissing werd genomen met een meerderheid van 62 van de 103 stemmen, met 10 onthoudingen. Dedecker, die dus niet op de verkiezingslijst zou mogen staan in weerwil van de eerdere toezegging van Bart De Wever, stapte daarop uit de N-VA. Uit onvrede met de gang van zaken trad Frieda Brepoels af als ondervoorzitter van de partij., 45156=Na de verkiezingen werd gesproken over een ""geel-zwarte zondag"", hetgeen enerzijds verwijst naar de Vlaamse kleuren, maar anderzijds ook naar ""zwarte zondag"", de dag waarop het Vlaams Blok zijn eerste grote overwinning boekte bij de federale verkiezingen in 1991., 43024=In de aanloop van de lokale verkiezingen van 2012 haalde N-VA een aantal voormalige leden van Vlaams Belang binnen voor de lokale lijsten. De komst van VB-afvalligen als Jurgen Ceder en Karim Van Overmeire lokten daarbij veel kritiek uit bij de tegenstanders. N-VA heeft het zelf over 40 mensen met een VB-verleden, Vlaams Belang heeft het over 50 mensen.[9], 32036=De daaropvolgende maandag 22 september stapte minister Geert Bourgeois uit de Vlaamse regering. Tijdens een persconferentie verklaarde hij dat hij in de ministerraad moest vaststellen dat ""alle collega-ministers wensen in te stappen in de dialoog, die vrijdag nog werd afgewezen. Op 5 september nog verbond de Vlaamse regering 'strikte en noodzakelijke' voorwaarden aan de start van deze dialoog. Zowel afgelopen vrijdag als vandaag opnieuw moet ik vaststellen dat aan die 'strikte en noodzakelijke' voorwaarden niet is voldaan.""[2], 39103=Bij de federale verkiezingen van 13 juni 2010 won N-VA de verkiezingen met iets minder dan 28% van de Vlaamse stemmen in de Kamer (31% in de senaat), zo werd het de grootste partij van Vlaanderen en Belgi√É¬´. De partij verwierf daardoor 27 kamerzetels. Daardoor is de N-VA de dominante politieke formatie in het Vlaamse politieke landschap geworden en neemt zij de plaats in die de CD&V decennialang bezette., 55102=Tegenstanders vragen zich af wat de betekenis is van de ""de markt aanzetten om zich sociaal op te stellen"". Op economisch vlak vertoont het partijprogramma van de N-VA bovendien een aantal gelijkenissen met de streefdoelen van de werkgeversorganisatie VOKA. Zo zou Bart De Wever tijdens regeringsonderhandelingen van 2010 (op 12 augustus 2010) het volgende hebben verklaard: ""Als VOKA niet tevreden is, ben ik niet tevreden"".[13] Die enigszins eenzijdige loyauteit van de N-VA heeft ertoe geleid dat tegenstanders van allerlei slag, inclusief het Vlaams Belang, de N-VA een neoliberale koers verwijten.[14][15][16][17][18], 23706=Het kartel CD&V/N-VA werd op 30 november 2006 tijdelijk stopgezet na de komst van Jean-Marie Dedecker en Boudewijn Bouckaert naar de N-VA. CD&V kon zich niet verzoenen met deze beslissing, mede doordat Jan Renders van het ACW, die traditioneel een grote invloed heeft op de partij, de komst van de donkerblauwe libertair Dedecker streng veroordeelde. N-VA overwoog daarop om alleen aan de federale verkiezingen van 2007 mee te doen, met Dedecker als kandidaat., 17529=In de herfst van 2001 ontstond de N-VA uit de Volksunie na interne onenigheid over het Lambermontakkoord. De Volksunie brak op in drie groepen: de Toekomstgroep (o.l.v. Bert Anciaux), Niet Splitsen en Vlaams-Nationaal (o.l.v. Geert Bourgeois). Na een ledenreferendum viel het besluit dat de groep Vlaams-Nationaal het grootste deel van het patrimonium van de Volksunie overerfde. Omdat de groep Vlaams-Nationaal net geen 50% van alle leden kon bekoren, moest de naam Volksunie evenwel verdwijnen. Op 13 oktober 2001 keurde de partijraad de naam Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, de beginselverklaring van de N-VA en het manifest van de N-VA goed., 22937=Bij de provincie- en gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van oktober 2006 trok CD&V/N-VA de lijn van de goede resultaten door. Met 31,7% voor de provincieraden boekte CD&V/N-VA een tweede verkiezingsoverwinning op rij. Opnieuw bleek het kartel CD&V/N-VA de grootste formatie van Vlaanderen. Het aantal gemeente- en OCMW-raadsleden van de N-VA nam sterk toe. In het Kempense Dessel behaalde een onafhankelijke N-VA-lijst zelfs een absolute meerderheid en werd Vlaams parlementslid Kris Van Dijck opnieuw burgemeester., 21240=In de zomer van 2003 werden er gesprekken gevoerd met CD&V over de vorming van een kartel, maar niet iedereen binnen de N-VA was daar even gelukkig mee. Op 2 september 2003 werd bekendgemaakt dat de gesprekken op niets uitgelopen waren, omdat de CD&V niet tegemoet kwam aan de eis van de N-VA om bij een regeringsvorming de vijf resoluties van het Vlaams parlement over de verdere staatshervorming in het Vlaams regeerprogramma op te nemen. Na het stuklopen van de onderhandelingen zag het er dus naar uit dat de N-VA alleen aan de verkiezingen zou deelnemen., 22102=Op 14 februari 2004 zegde de CD&V toch toe om de 5 resoluties van het Vlaams parlement met het kartel te verdedigen. Samen met een slechte peiling volstond dit voor de N-VA-top om de partijraad van de N-VA over te halen en een kartel met CD&V tot stand te brengen. Onder de kartelnaam CD&V/N-VA - of 'Vlaams kartel' √¢¬Ä¬ì namen beide partijen vervolgens deel aan de Vlaamse parlementsverkiezingen van 2004. Het kartel werd de grootste politieke formatie in Vlaanderen met iets meer dan 1 miljoen stemmen, of 26%., 18415=Onder leiding van Geert Bourgeois ging de partij in 2003 voor de eerste maal naar de verkiezingen, maar enkel in West-Vlaanderen slaagde de jonge partij erin om de nieuwe kiesdrempel van 5% te halen. De kiesdrempels waren ingevoerd door de paars-groene regering Verhofstadt I (1999-2003 met VLD, sp.a, Agalev (onthield zich bij de stemming), PS, MR en Ecolo). De partij behield dus enkel Geert Bourgeois als parlementslid, en was niet meer vertegenwoordigd in de Senaat., 40912=Door deze overwinning krijgt de partij die net verhuisde naar een nieuw partijgebouw een grotere financi√É¬´le armslag met 4,6 miljoen euro extra per jaar. Alzo kan men ook 63 nieuwe parlementaire medewerkers aantrekken en een studiedienst bemannen.[8] Samen met de PS is de N-VA de leidende politieke formatie geworden in Belgi√É¬´. Daardoor kwamen beide partijen aan zet bij de vorming van een nieuwe federale regering. Daarbij kwam het eind augustus 2010 tot een impasse. Na het verkiezingssucces van 13 juni steeg het aantal leden aanzienlijk en bereikte in juni 2012 een 30 000 leden., 31035=Op 21 september 2008 zei een massaal bijgewoond N-VA-ledencongres (1700 deelnemers) in het Gentse ICC het vertrouwen in de federale regering Leterme I op. De N-VA weigerde deel te nemen aan nieuwe communautaire dialoog die Kris Peeters vanuit de Vlaamse regering Peeters I wilde opstarten, omdat de Vlaams-nationale partij daarin geen garanties zag op een doorbraak in de staatshervorming en, gezien de houding van de Franstalige partijen sinds juni 2007, geen enkel vertrouwen had in het welslagen van zo'n dialoog., 51303=Naar aanleiding van de federale verkiezingen van 2010 formuleerde de partij haar programma., 39595=De populariteit van de N-VA, en dan voornamelijk die van partijvoorzitter Bart De Wever, was volgens sommige media na de verkiezingsuitslag[6][7] het gevolg van De Wevers deelname aan het spelprogramma De Slimste Mens ter Wereld van Woestijnvis. Het werd echter niet wetenschappelijk aangetoond dat deze deelname een rol speelde bij de verkiezingen van 7 juni 2009 (Vlaams Parlement) of een jaar later bij de verkiezingen van 13 juni 2010 (Federaal Parlement en Senaat). Mogelijk was het spelletje wel het begin van zijn naambekendheid bij het grote publiek., 16870=Voorlopers van de N-VA waren de Volksunie (van 1954 tot 2001) en daarna VU&ID (eenheidslijst van VU en iD21) vanaf 1997 tot en met 2001.}","Sun, 19 Jul 2015 15:07:41 GMT","Overzicht Vlaamse Regeringsdeelnames[bewerken] Na de verkiezingen werd gesproken over een ""geel-zwarte zondag"", hetgeen enerzijds verwijst naar de Vlaamse kleuren, maar anderzijds ook naar ""zwarte zondag"", de dag waarop het Vlaams Blok zijn eerste grote overwinning boekte bij de federale verkiezingen in 1991.

Het bereikte akkoord tussen CD&V en de N-VA, dat normaal besproken zou worden op de partijraad van januari 2007, werd door de omstandigheden reeds aan de partijraad van 9 december 2006 voorgelegd. CD&V had N-VA voor de keuze gesteld: een kartel zonder Dedecker op de gemeenschappelijke lijst, of geen kartel. Op die N-VA-partijraad van 9 december werd, op basis van het akkoord, beslist om voor de federale verkiezingen van 2007 een kartel te vormen met de CD&V. De beslissing werd genomen met een meerderheid van 62 van de 103 stemmen, met 10 onthoudingen. Dedecker, die dus niet op de verkiezingslijst zou mogen staan in weerwil van de eerdere toezegging van Bart De Wever, stapte daarop uit de N-VA. Uit onvrede met de gang van zaken trad Frieda Brepoels af als ondervoorzitter van de partij., 45156=Na de verkiezingen werd gesproken over een ""geel-zwarte zondag"", hetgeen enerzijds verwijst naar de Vlaamse kleuren, maar anderzijds ook naar ""zwarte zondag"", de dag waarop het Vlaams Blok zijn eerste grote overwinning boekte bij de federale verkiezingen in 1991., 43024=In de aanloop van de lokale verkiezingen van 2012 haalde N-VA een aantal voormalige leden van Vlaams Belang binnen voor de lokale lijsten. De komst van VB-afvalligen als Jurgen Ceder en Karim Van Overmeire lokten daarbij veel kritiek uit bij de tegenstanders. N-VA heeft het zelf over 40 mensen met een VB-verleden, Vlaams Belang heeft het over 50 mensen.[9], 32036=De daaropvolgende maandag 22 september stapte minister Geert Bourgeois uit de Vlaamse regering. Tijdens een persconferentie verklaarde hij dat hij in de ministerraad moest vaststellen dat ""alle collega-ministers wensen in te stappen in de dialoog, die vrijdag nog werd afgewezen. Op 5 september nog verbond de Vlaamse regering 'strikte en noodzakelijke' voorwaarden aan de start van deze dialoog. Zowel afgelopen vrijdag als vandaag opnieuw moet ik vaststellen dat aan die 'strikte en noodzakelijke' voorwaarden niet is voldaan.""[2], 39103=Bij de federale verkiezingen van 13 juni 2010 won N-VA de verkiezingen met iets minder dan 28% van de Vlaamse stemmen in de Kamer (31% in de senaat), zo werd het de grootste partij van Vlaanderen en Belgi√É¬´. De partij verwierf daardoor 27 kamerzetels. Daardoor is de N-VA de dominante politieke formatie in het Vlaamse politieke landschap geworden en neemt zij de plaats in die de CD&V decennialang bezette., 55102=Tegenstanders vragen zich af wat de betekenis is van de ""de markt aanzetten om zich sociaal op te stellen"". Op economisch vlak vertoont het partijprogramma van de N-VA bovendien een aantal gelijkenissen met de streefdoelen van de werkgeversorganisatie VOKA. Zo zou Bart De Wever tijdens regeringsonderhandelingen van 2010 (op 12 augustus 2010) het volgende hebben verklaard: ""Als VOKA niet tevreden is, ben ik niet tevreden"".[13] Die enigszins eenzijdige loyauteit van de N-VA heeft ertoe geleid dat tegenstanders van allerlei slag, inclusief het Vlaams Belang, de N-VA een neoliberale koers verwijten.[14][15][16][17][18], 23706=Het kartel CD&V/N-VA werd op 30 november 2006 tijdelijk stopgezet na de komst van Jean-Marie Dedecker en Boudewijn Bouckaert naar de N-VA. CD&V kon zich niet verzoenen met deze beslissing, mede doordat Jan Renders van het ACW, die traditioneel een grote invloed heeft op de partij, de komst van de donkerblauwe libertair Dedecker streng veroordeelde. N-VA overwoog daarop om alleen aan de federale verkiezingen van 2007 mee te doen, met Dedecker als kandidaat., 17529=In de herfst van 2001 ontstond de N-VA uit de Volksunie na interne onenigheid over het Lambermontakkoord. De Volksunie brak op in drie groepen: de Toekomstgroep (o.l.v. Bert Anciaux), Niet Splitsen en Vlaams-Nationaal (o.l.v. Geert Bourgeois). Na een ledenreferendum viel het besluit dat de groep Vlaams-Nationaal het grootste deel van het patrimonium van de Volksunie overerfde. Omdat de groep Vlaams-Nationaal net geen 50% van alle leden kon bekoren, moest de naam Volksunie evenwel verdwijnen. Op 13 oktober 2001 keurde de partijraad de naam Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, de beginselverklaring van de N-VA en het manifest van de N-VA goed., 22937=Bij de provincie- en gemeenteraadsverkiezingen van oktober 2006 trok CD&V/N-VA de lijn van de goede resultaten door. Met 31,7% voor de provincieraden boekte CD&V/N-VA een tweede verkiezingsoverwinning op rij. Opnieuw bleek het kartel CD&V/N-VA de grootste formatie van Vlaanderen. Het aantal gemeente- en OCMW-raadsleden van de N-VA nam sterk toe. In het Kempense Dessel behaalde een onafhankelijke N-VA-lijst zelfs een absolute meerderheid en werd Vlaams parlementslid Kris Van Dijck opnieuw burgemeester., 21240=In de zomer van 2003 werden er gesprekken gevoerd met CD&V over de vorming van een kartel, maar niet iedereen binnen de N-VA was daar even gelukkig mee. Op 2 september 2003 werd bekendgemaakt dat de gesprekken op niets uitgelopen waren, omdat de CD&V niet tegemoet kwam aan de eis van de N-VA om bij een regeringsvorming de vijf resoluties van het Vlaams parlement over de verdere staatshervorming in het Vlaams regeerprogramma op te nemen. Na het stuklopen van de onderhandelingen zag het er dus naar uit dat de N-VA alleen aan de verkiezingen zou deelnemen., 22102=Op 14 februari 2004 zegde de CD&V toch toe om de 5 resoluties van het Vlaams parlement met het kartel te verdedigen. Samen met een slechte peiling volstond dit voor de N-VA-top om de partijraad van de N-VA over te halen en een kartel met CD&V tot stand te brengen. Onder de kartelnaam CD&V/N-VA - of 'Vlaams kartel' √¢¬Ä¬ì namen beide partijen vervolgens deel aan de Vlaamse parlementsverkiezingen van 2004. Het kartel werd de grootste politieke formatie in Vlaanderen met iets meer dan 1 miljoen stemmen, of 26%., 18415=Onder leiding van Geert Bourgeois ging de partij in 2003 voor de eerste maal naar de verkiezingen, maar enkel in West-Vlaanderen slaagde de jonge partij erin om de nieuwe kiesdrempel van 5% te halen. De kiesdrempels waren ingevoerd door de paars-groene regering Verhofstadt I (1999-2003 met VLD, sp.a, Agalev (onthield zich bij de stemming), PS, MR en Ecolo). De partij behield dus enkel Geert Bourgeois als parlementslid, en was niet meer vertegenwoordigd in de Senaat., 40912=Door deze overwinning krijgt de partij die net verhuisde naar een nieuw partijgebouw een grotere financi√É¬´le armslag met 4,6 miljoen euro extra per jaar. Alzo kan men ook 63 nieuwe parlementaire medewerkers aantrekken en een studiedienst bemannen.[8] Samen met de PS is de N-VA de leidende politieke formatie geworden in Belgi√É¬´. Daardoor kwamen beide partijen aan zet bij de vorming van een nieuwe federale regering. Daarbij kwam het eind augustus 2010 tot een impasse. Na het verkiezingssucces van 13 juni steeg het aantal leden aanzienlijk en bereikte in juni 2012 een 30 000 leden., 31035=Op 21 september 2008 zei een massaal bijgewoond N-VA-ledencongres (1700 deelnemers) in het Gentse ICC het vertrouwen in de federale regering Leterme I op. De N-VA weigerde deel te nemen aan nieuwe communautaire dialoog die Kris Peeters vanuit de Vlaamse regering Peeters I wilde opstarten, omdat de Vlaams-nationale partij daarin geen garanties zag op een doorbraak in de staatshervorming en, gezien de houding van de Franstalige partijen sinds juni 2007, geen enkel vertrouwen had in het welslagen van zo'n dialoog., 51303=Naar aanleiding van de federale verkiezingen van 2010 formuleerde de partij haar programma., 39595=De populariteit van de N-VA, en dan voornamelijk die van partijvoorzitter Bart De Wever, was volgens sommige media na de verkiezingsuitslag[6][7] het gevolg van De Wevers deelname aan het spelprogramma De Slimste Mens ter Wereld van Woestijnvis. Het werd echter niet wetenschappelijk aangetoond dat deze deelname een rol speelde bij de verkiezingen van 7 juni 2009 (Vlaams Parlement) of een jaar later bij de verkiezingen van 13 juni 2010 (Federaal Parlement en Senaat). Mogelijk was het spelletje wel het begin van zijn naambekendheid bij het grote publiek., 16870=Voorlopers van de N-VA waren de Volksunie (van 1954 tot 2001) en daarna VU&ID (eenheidslijst van VU en iD21) vanaf 1997 tot en met 2001.}","Sun, 19 Jul 2015 15:07:41 GMT","Overzicht Vlaamse Regeringsdeelnames[bewerken] Na de verkiezingen werd gesproken over een ""geel-zwarte zondag"", hetgeen enerzijds verwijst naar de Vlaamse kleuren, maar anderzijds ook naar ""zwarte zondag"", de dag waarop het Vlaams Blok zijn eerste grote overwinning boekte bij de federale verkiezingen in 1991. N-VA werd bij de verkiezingen de grote overwinnaar in Vlaanderen. In 41 gemeenten werd het de grootste lokale partij, waaronder in Antwerpen, waar voorzitter Bart De Wever burgemeester werd. Op andere plaatsen werd de partij vaak ook een van de grootste partijen met percentages rond de 20 procent. Op provinciaal niveau werd N-VA de grootste partij met circa 28% van de stemmen. In Vlaams-Brabant, Antwerpen en Oost-Vlaanderen werd het de grootste partij; in Limburg en West-Vlaanderen tweede.[10][11] In zijn overwinningsspeech had De Wever het over een signaal voor de regering-Di Rupo. Hij bestempelde de overwinning van zijn partij en het verlies van alle regeringspartijen als teken dat de Vlamingen de ""belastingsregering"" niet lusten. Hij waarschuwde de Franstaligen om zich voor te bereiden op confederalisme, waar de partij voor zal ijveren bij de volgende verkiezingen, in 2014. Di Rupo wimpelde de waarschuwing af door te wijzen op het lokale karakter van de verkiezingen.[12] In de aanloop van de lokale verkiezingen van 2012 haalde N-VA een aantal voormalige leden van","Regering-Peeters II Kris Peeters CD&V, sp.a, N-VA 2009-2014 Regering-Bourgeois Geert Bourgeois N-VA, CD&V en Open Vld 2014-heden Overzicht Federale Regeringsdeelnames[bewerken] Regering Premier Partijen Periode Regering-Michel Charles Michel (MR) N-VA, CD&V, Open Vld en MR 2014-heden Programma[bewerken] Naar aanleiding van de federale verkiezingen van 2010 formuleerde de partij haar programma.

To make it permanent you can add the options to the Device section of your xorg.conf:       While I saw this setting in someone's xorg.conf I couldn't actually make it work for me. Hints welcome!   Note     Making it permanent Apart from that I had to play around with the Advanced Effects settings as kwin's performance seemed to have dropped. If you're lucky your KDE4 will be snappier than ever. If you're unlucky and it stays the same or gets even worse, try experimenting with the value of InitialPixmapPlacement, setting it to 1 or 3. Set the following options: $ nvidia-settings -a InitialPixmapPlacement=2 -a GlyphCache=1 Make sure you the NVIDIA kernel module gets loaded by either rebooting or rmmod/modprobe (Of course you'll also have to restart xorg) Install the latest NVIDIA graphics driver (173.14.09 works fine for me)   √Ç¬†","I.P.P. = InitialPixmapPlacement G.C. = GlyphCache Known problems I haven't done a lot of testing using this setup, so in case you encounter any unwanted effects (on 3D applications or other 2D applications), please put them below. Following those steps with cards from the 7xxx series is said to increase GPU temperature a lot.

If you have constraints like ""Friday only"" or ""can only talk for 30 mins"" then please indicate these and try and grab slots in the timetable below as necessary. I've just added a timetable for Saturday too so we can spill over there as we are now in the wonderful position of having more talks than we can fit on Friday (without reducing talks to 30 mins). Neil Brown - Explicit concurrency with the CHP library Tom Harper - Stream fusion on Haskell Unicode strings Ganesh Sittampalam - Squiggle: using associated types to embed SQL Neil Mitchell - Hoogle 4, fast type searching (I gave an AngloHaskell 2007 talk, so would be happy to defer to someone else) Philippa Cowderoy - Fusion-powered EDSLs Tristan Allwood - Making zippers for structured editors Matthew Sackman could talk on automatic type level static analysis of embedded Domain Specific Languages. Simon Marlow has promised to keynote on Parallel GC The room booked at Imperial has multiple projectors and connections for laptops and so forth. It even has whiteboards. It wouldn't be AngloHaskell without some talks, so volunteers please!","3.5.1.1 Friday Lunch We will be able to provide some food (as-well as tea/coffee/water) for the Friday Lunch spot.

I've assumed a rough 35mins + 10min questions/overrun/discussion per talk - shout if this is a problem. 3.5 Timetable Please please keep offering talks. If you have constraints like ""Friday only"" or ""can only talk for 30 mins"" then please indicate these and try and grab slots in the timetable below as necessary. I've just added a timetable for Saturday too so we can spill over there as we are now in the wonderful position of having more talks than we can fit on Friday (without reducing talks to 30 mins). Neil Brown - Explicit concurrency with the CHP library Tom Harper - Stream fusion on Haskell Unicode strings Ganesh Sittampalam - Squiggle: using associated types to embed SQL Neil Mitchell - Hoogle 4, fast type searching (I gave an AngloHaskell 2007 talk, so would be happy to defer to someone else) Philippa Cowderoy - Fusion-powered EDSLs Tristan Allwood - Making zippers for structured editors Matthew Sackman could talk on automatic type level static analysis of embedded Domain Specific Languages. Simon Marlow has promised to keynote on Parallel GC The room booked at Imperial has multiple projectors and connections for laptops and so forth. It even has whiteboards. It wouldn't be AngloHaskell without some talks, so volunteers please!","4pm Talk 5 (Neil Brown) 4:45pm Functional grit - small talks that may grow into functional pearls.

This makes it so creating a lock-down easy as the ID is used as the key. Clubs and Activities There has to be over 50 clubs and organizations on campus.

Statistical analysis establishes that at least 102,800 (+/- 11,000) Timorese died as a result of the conflict. Approximately 18,600 (+/- 1000) Timorese were killed or disappeared, while the remainder died due to hunger and illness in excess of what would be expected due to peacetime mortality., 29383=The final report of the CAVR was handed over to the President of Timor-Leste on 31 October 2005.

He calculates that, based on the GDP-growth figures first published in each quarter, the euro area would have grown by an annual average of only 1.6% in the six years to 2004. Yet the latest figures put the growth rate at 2.0%. In contrast, the first published figures gave America an average growth rate of 3.1%; but that has now been shaved down to 2.8%. The revisions have cut the reported gap between growth rates in America and the euro area in half. As a result, the euro area's GDP per head has in fact grown at the same pace as America's., 8418=Consequently, there is ""a 25 percent relative risk reduction."" He would prefer focusing on the difference in the number of deaths which yields the more revealing and perhaps more honest statement: ""The absolute risk reduction is 4 minus 3, that is, 1 out of 1000 women (which corresponds to .1 percent)."" However, ""Counting on their clients' innumeracy, organizations that want to impress upon clients the benefits of treatment generally report them in terms of relative risk reduction...applicants [for grants] often feel compelled to report relative risk reductions because they sound more impressive."" Although he did not use this example, one's relative ""risk"" of winning the lottery is infinitely greater if one buys a ticket, yet one's absolute ""risk"" of winning has hardly improved at all., 32946=Elulsiveness of Powerball is revealed in the math Minneapolis Star Tribune, Feb. 15, 2006 Mike Meyers, 16465=Popular herb shows no benefit for prostate Wall street journal, Feb. 9, 2006 Syllvia Pagan Westphal, 40173=These researchers studied 682,919 men and divided them into five groups (lone fathers with custody of their child/children, lone fathers without custody, childless men with a wife, childless men without a wife, and men with a wife and men with a wife and child/children.

Gigerenzer would prefer, and this is one of his main points, that any statistical data be given in counts rather than in percentages, especially percentages without a base rate, such as relative risk which he views as the most misleading.}",,"Some of the puzzlement disappears if we deal with counts; the table below is equivalent to Gigerenzer's ""tree"" diagram. Assume 50 Boys and 50 Girls to start with. Every one of the 50 Boys will test as a Boy--none of the Boys test as a Girl; of the 50 Girls, 25 will test as a Boy and 25 will test as a girl. Therefore, P(Girl| Test Girl) = 1. One is tempted to to explain the switch by using the lingo of medical testing: false positives, false negatives, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. However, one hesitates to designate either gender as diseased even though the mathematics is the same. Here is an example he did not consider but it also illustrates the superiority of dealing with counts. Instead of two populations--diseased and healthy--which are greatly different in size, consider Boys and Girls and the desire to predict gender based on some simple test. Assume that 50% of births are Boys so that P(Boy) = P(Girl) = 1/2. A simple, inexpensive, non-invasive gender-testing procedure indicates that it is ""perfect"" for boys, P(Test Boy| Boy) = 1, implying P(Test Girl| Boy) = 0. Unfortunately, this simple, inexpensive, non-invasive gender-testing procedure for girls is a ""coin toss,"" P(Test Girl| Girl) = P(Test Boy| Girl) = 1/2. Application of Bayes theorem yields what seems to be a strange inversion, P(Boy| Test Boy) = 2/3 and P(Girl| Test Girl) = 1. That is, somehow, ""perfection"" switched from Boy to Girl.","Gigerenzer rightly concludes that the language of statistics is not natural for most individuals. Perhaps the puzzlement in this specific example is at least partly due to the natural language known as English. Boys, Girls, Test Boys and Test Girls are too confusing. . Replace ""Boy"" by ""Norwegian"" and ""Girl"" by ""German"" and assume that there are as many Norwegians as Germans. Let every Norwegian be ""Blond,"" so that P(Blond| Norwegian) = 1 and only half the Germans are Blond. Thus, P(German| Not Blond) =1; the switch, P(German| Not Blond) = P(Blond| Norwegian) = 1, is rather obvious. Is the this situation easier to understand because of the linguistics--hair color and ethnicity are easily distinct as Test Boy and Boy are not? DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1. Gigerenzer has a chapter entitled, ""(Un)Informed Consent."" Based on your experience, what do you imagine the chapter contains? 2. A drawing of two tables (that is, physical tables on which things are placed) appears on page 10. He claims the tables (due to Roger Shepard) are identical in size and shape. After staring at them in disbelief of the claim, how would you verify the contention? 3. Physicians sometime make the following type of statement:""Never mind the statistics, I treat every patient as an individual."" Defend this assertion. Criticize this assertion. 4.
